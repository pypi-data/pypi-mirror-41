Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.geo.openlayers enables `Openlayers`_ machinery into Plone.
        
        This package registers two javascript files into Plone javascript registry:
        
        1. OpenLayers.js
        2. proj4js-compressed.js

           are present.
        
        
        Integration example
        ===================
        
        You can include openlayers in a Plone browser page in this way
        (for further information about openlayers see
        other `openlayers examples`_)::

                            theme: null
                          });
                          map.addLayer(new OpenLayers.Layer.OSM("OpenStreetMap"));
                          map.setCenter(new OpenLayers.LonLat(7, 45).transform(
                              new OpenLayers.Projection("EPSG:4326"),
                              map.getProjectionObject()
                          ), 5);
        
                        });
                      }(jQuery));

        Updating this package
        =====================
        
        When a new version of OpenLayers is released, the javascript on this package
        can be updated by using the Makefile in the root directory. Commands available:
        
          * build - it builds a new version of OpenLayer javascript.
          * copysrc - it copies all necessary files in plone resources directory.
          * dist - it is the default command, it executes all previous commands.

          [davidjb]

          headings (eg content titles) would cause popups to fill the map.

        - changed Browser import from Testing.testbrowser [gborelli]
        - added z3c.autoinclude entry point [gborelli]
        
        
        0.2.2 (2010-12-28)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed css registry entries [gborelli]
        
        
        0.2.1 (2010-11-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated Openlayers to 2.10 version
        
        
        0.2 (2010-10-31)
        ----------------
        * renamed cgeo-openlayers css and included in css registry [gborelli]
        * removed openlayers-macros [gborelli]
        * Added CSS for definition lists within the framed cloud popups,
          as used in collective.geo.kml
          [rockdj]
        * Added ZCML registration for all skin subdirectories.  Without this,
          elements like the Edit toolbar don't appear when Plone isn't running
          in debug mode.
          [rockdj]
        * Updated OpenLayers.js to 2.8 (+styles and resources)
        * Register all browser pages and resources for IOpenLayers browser
          layer
        * Removed geo-point.js in favour of editing features provided by OpenLayers
        * Updated coordinate reference order to be consistent with WGS 1984
          reference system.  This involves standardising the coordinate order
          to be [longitude, latitude] rather than [latitude, longitude].
          [rockdj]
        * Gave the Map element a relative position via CSS to allow Plone
          drop-down menus to appear over the top (z-index doesn't apply
          unless position is specified).
          [rockdj]
        * Added ZCML registration for 'img' and 'theme' skin subdirectories.
          Without registration, these folders are unable to be seen in Plone
          and the OpenLayers controls don't appear.
          [rockdj]
        * Added unit tests to ensure skin subdirectory registration works.
          [rockdj]
        
        0.1 (2009-06-19)
        ----------------
        
        * Initial release
