* @josemotta ported it to python 3.6 as part of a homeassistant component.

Please see basic sample:

from homeassistant.const import TEMP_CELSIUS
from homeassistant.helpers.entity import Entity

REQUIREMENTS = ['smbus2==0.2.2', 'VL53L1X2==0.1.2']

def setup_platform(hass, config, add_devices, discovery_info=None):
    """Setup the sensor platform."""
    add_devices([TofSensor()])


class TofSensor(Entity):
    """Representation of a Sensor."""

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the sensor."""
        self._state = None

    @property
    def name(self):
        """Return the name of the sensor."""
        return 'VL53L1X'

    @property
    def state(self):
        """Return the state of the sensor."""
        return self._state

    @property
    def unit_of_measurement(self):
        """Return the unit of measurement."""
        return TEMP_CELSIUS

    def update(self):
        """Fetch new state data for the sensor.

        This is the only method that should fetch new data for Home Assistant.
        """
        self._state = 23
