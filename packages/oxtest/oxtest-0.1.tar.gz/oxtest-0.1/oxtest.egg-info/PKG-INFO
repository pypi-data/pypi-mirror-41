        Tips and Tricks
        ===============
        
        PhantomJS
        ---------
        
        PhantomJS is a great selenium driver. There are a few things you may
        want to keep in mind:
        
        1. Use
           ``service_args=['--ignore-ssl-errors=true', '--ssl-protocol=any']``
           when creating the driver (e.g.,
           ``driver =  webdriver.PhantomJS(service_args=...)``). This is helpful
           if you are doing tests and do not have proper SSL certificates
           installed.
        2. Do something like ``driver.set_page_load_timeout(300)`` if you have
           pages which take a while.
        3. Do something like ``driver.maximize_window()`` to make sure the
           window is big enough to "see" the page.
        4. Make sure you have at least version 2 or things will be broken.
        
           -  Installing can be a pain and you may have to do it manually (e.g.,
              see `this
              gist <https://gist.github.com/telbiyski/ec56a92d7114b8631c906c18064ce620>`__).
