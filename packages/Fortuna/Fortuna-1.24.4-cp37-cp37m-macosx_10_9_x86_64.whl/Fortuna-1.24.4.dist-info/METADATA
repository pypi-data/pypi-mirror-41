# Fortuna: Fast & Flexible Random Value Generators
Fortuna replaces much of the functionality of Python's Random module, often achieving 10x better performance. However, the most interesting bits of Fortuna are found in the high-level abstractions like FlexCat, QuantumMonty and TruffleShuffle.

The core functionality of Fortuna is based on the Mersenne Twister Algorithm by Makoto Matsumoto (松本 眞) and Takuji Nishimura (西村 拓士). Fortuna is not appropriate for cryptography of any kind. Fortuna is for games, data science, AI and experimental programming, not security.

The Fortuna generator was designed to use hardware seeding exclusively. This allows the generator to be completely encapsulated.

Installation: `$ pip install Fortuna` or download and build it from source. Installation on some platforms may require the latest version of Cython, python3 dev tools, and a modern C++17 compiler. Fortuna is designed, built and tested for MacOS X, and also happens to work out-of-the-box with many flavors of Linux and Unix. Fortuna is not supported on Windows.

Fortuna is built for the default CPython implementation standard, other implementations may or may not support c-extensions like Fortuna. A pure Python version of Fortuna is included in the extras folder. The Fortuna c-extension is roughly an order of magnitude faster than the pure Python version, but they offer the same API and functionality.

## Fortuna Random Functions
### Random Numbers
`Fortuna.random_range(lo: int, hi: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [lo..hi] inclusive. Up to 15x faster than `random.randint()`. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.random_below(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in the exclusive range [0..num) for positive values of num. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.d(sides: int) -> int`. Represents a single die roll of a given size die. Returns a random integer in the range [1..sides]. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.dice(rolls: int, sides: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [X..Y] where X = rolls and Y = rolls * sides. The return value represents the sum of multiple rolls of the same size die. Geometric distribution based on the number and size of the dice rolled. Complexity scales primarily with the number of rolls, not the size of the dice.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus(num: int) -> int`. Negative and positive input values of num will produce equivalent distributions. Returns a random integer in range [-num..num]. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus_linear(num: int) -> int`. Negative and positive input values of num will produce equivalent distributions. Returns a random integer in range [-num..num]. Zero peak geometric distribution, up triangle.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus_curve(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in the bounded range [-num..num]. Zero peak gaussian distribution, bounded stretched bell curve: mean = 0, variance = num / pi.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus_linear_down(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [-num..num]. Edge peak geometric distribution, down triangle.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus_curve_down(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in the range [-num..num]. Edge peak gaussian distribution, upside down bell curve.

`Fortuna.stretched_bell(num: int) -> int`. This is an unbounded plus_or_minus_curve. Returns a random integer with high probability to be in range [-num..num]. Zero peak gaussian distribution, unbounded stretched bell curve: mean = 0, variance = num / pi.

`Fortuna.zero_flat(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.zero_cool(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Zero peak, geometric distribution, lefthand triangle.

`Fortuna.zero_extreme(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Zero peak, gaussian distribution, half bell curve.

`Fortuna.max_cool(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Max peak (num), geometric distribution, righthand triangle.

`Fortuna.max_extreme(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Max peak (num), gaussian distribution, half bell curve.

`Fortuna.mostly_middle(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Middle peak (num / 2), geometric distribution, up triangle. Ranges that span an even number of values will have two dominant values in the middle rather than one, this will guarantee that the probability distribution is always symmetrical.

`Fortuna.mostly_center(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Middle peak (num / 2), gaussian distribution, bell curve: mean = num / 2, variance = num / pi.

`Fortuna.mostly_not_middle(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Edge peaks, geometric distribution, down triangle. Ranges that span an even number of values will have two dominant values in the middle rather than one, this will guarantee that the probability distribution is always symmetrical.

`Fortuna.mostly_not_center(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Edge peaks, gaussian distribution, upside down bell curve.

`Fortuna.random_float() -> float`. Returns a random float in range [0.0..1.0) exclusive. Same as random.random().


### Random Truth
`Fortuna.percent_true(num: int) -> bool`. Always returns False if num is 0 or less, always returns True if num is 100 or more. Any value of num in range [1..99] will produce True or False based on the value of num - the probability of True as a percentage.

`Fortuna.percent_true_float(num: float) -> bool`. Always returns False if num is 0.0 or less, always returns True if num is 100.0 or more. It will produce True or False based on the value of num - the probability of True as a percentage. Same as percent_true but with floating point accuracy.


### Random Sequence Values
`Fortuna.random_value(arr) -> value`. Returns a random value from a sequence (list or tuple), uniform distribution, non-destructive. Up to 10x faster than random.choice().

`Fortuna.pop_random_value(arr: list) -> value`. Returns and removes a random value from a sequence list, uniform distribution, destructive. Not included in the test suite due to it's destructive nature. This is the only destructive function in the module, use with care. It will raise an error if the list is empty.


### Random Table Values
`Fortuna.cumulative_weighted_choice(table) -> value`. Core function for the WeightedChoice base class. Produces a custom distribution of values based on cumulative weights. Requires input format: `[(weight, value), ... ]` sorted in ascending order by weight. Weights must be unique positive integers. See WeightedChoice class for a more comprehensive solution that verifies and optimizes the table. Up to 15x faster than random.choices()


### Utility Functions
`Fortuna.min_max(num: int, lo: int, hi: int) -> int`. Used to force a number in to the range [lo..hi]. Returns num if it is already in the proper range. Returns lo if num is less than lo. Returns hi if num is greater than hi.

`Fortuna.analytic_continuation(func: staticmethod, num: int) -> int`. Used to map a positive only function to the negative number line for complete input domain coverage. The function to be analytically continued must take an integer as input and return an integer for output.

`Fortuna.distribution_timer(func: staticmethod, call_sig=None, num_cycles=100000)`. The `func` arg is the callable object to be analyzed. `call_sig` is an optional label, this is useful for methods that don't have the `__qualname__` property. Optional arg `num_cycles` will set the total number invocations.

`Fortuna.flatten(itm: object, flat: bool = True) -> object`. Flatten will recursively unpack callable objects. If itm is not callable - flatten will just return it, otherwise it recursively calls itm() and returns the result. Callable objects that require arguments, or for some other reason can't be called, are returned in an uncalled state. If `flat=False`, this function is effectively the id function and just returns whatever you pass it.

`Fortuna.shuffle(arr: list) -> None`. Alternate Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm. More than an order of magnitude faster than random.shuffle().


## Fortuna Random Classes
### Sequence Wrappers
#### Truffle Shuffle
Returns a random value from the wrapped sequence.

Produces a uniform distribution with a wide spread. Longer sequences will naturally push duplicates even farther apart. This behavior gives rise to output sequences that seem less mechanical than other random sequences.

Flatten: TruffleShuffle will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True. A callable object is any function, method or lambda.

- Constructor takes a copy of a sequence (generator, list or tuple) of arbitrary values.
- Values can be any Python object that can be passed around.
- Features continuous smart micro-shuffling: The Truffle Shuffle.
- Performance scales by some small fraction of the length of the input sequence.

```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle


truffle_shuffle = TruffleShuffle(["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"])
truffle_shuffle()  # returns a random value, cycled uniform distribution.
```


#### The Quantum Monty
QuantumMonty is a set of strategies for producing random values from a sequence where the probability of each value is based on the method or "monty" you choose. For example: the mostly_front monty produces random values where the beginning of the sequence is geometrically more common than the back. This always produces a 45 degree slope down no matter how many values are in the data.

The Quantum Monty Algorithm is special, it produces values by overlapping the probability waves of six of the other methods. The distribution it produces is a gentle curve up towards the middle with a distinct bump in the center of the sequence.

Flatten: QuantumMonty will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are not called. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.

- Constructor takes a copy of a sequence (generator, list or tuple) of arbitrary values.
- Sequence length must be greater than three, best if ten or more.
- Values can be any Python object that can be passed around... string, int, list, function etc.
- Performance scales by some tiny fraction of the length of the sequence. Method scaling may vary slightly.

```python
from Fortuna import QuantumMonty


quantum_monty = QuantumMonty(["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"])

# Each of the following methods will return a random value from the sequence.
quantum_monty.mostly_front()        # Mostly from the front of the list (geometric descending)
quantum_monty.mostly_middle()       # Mostly from the middle of the list (geometric pyramid)
quantum_monty.mostly_back()         # Mostly from the back of the list (geometric ascending)
quantum_monty.mostly_first()        # Mostly from the very front of the list (stretched gaussian descending)
quantum_monty.mostly_center()       # Mostly from the very center of the list (stretched gaussian bell curve)
quantum_monty.mostly_last()         # Mostly from the very back of the list (stretched gaussian ascending)
quantum_monty.quantum_monty()       # Quantum Monty Algorithm. Overlapping probability waves.
quantum_monty.mostly_flat()         # Uniform flat distribution (see Fortuna.random_value if this is the only behavior you need.)
quantum_monty.mostly_cycle()        # Cycled uniform flat distribution (see TruffleShuffle)
quantum_monty.mostly_not_middle()   # Mostly from the edges of the list (geometric upside down pyramid)
quantum_monty.mostly_not_center()   # Mostly from the outside edges of the list (inverted gaussian bell curve)
quantum_monty.quantum_not_monty()   # Inverted Quantum Monty Algorithm.
```


#### RandomWalk
RandomWalk wraps a sequence of values, the data is modeled as a continuous ring. The sequence must not be empty. When instantiated, RandomWalk will randomly pick a starting point. When called, the algorithm randomly walks to an adjacent position and returns the value. RandomWalk will move forward or backward in the data set and never fall off the edge, instead it will wrap to the other side.

RandomWalk produces a flat uniform distribution.

Flatten: RandomWalk will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are not called. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.


```python
from Fortuna import RandomWalk


random_walk = RandomWalk(["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"])

random_walk()      # returns a random value from the table.
```


### Table Wrappers
#### Weighted Choice: Custom Rarity
Weighted Choice offers two strategies for selecting random values from a sequence where programmable rarity is desired. Both produce a custom distribution of values based on the weights of the values. Both are up to 10x faster than random.choices()

Flatten: Both will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.

- Constructor takes a copy of a sequence of weighted value pairs... `[(weight, value), ... ]`
- Automatically optimizes the sequence for correctness and optimal call performance for large data sets.
- The sequence must not be empty, and each pair must contain a weight and a value.
- Weights must be positive integers.
- Values can be any Python object that can be passed around... string, int, list, function etc.
- Performance scales by some fraction of the length of the sequence.

The following examples produce equivalent distributions with comparable performance.
The choice to use one strategy over the other is purely about which one suits you or your data best. Relative weights are easier to understand at a glance. However, many RPG Treasure Tables map rather nicely to a cumulative weighted strategy.


##### Cumulative Weight Strategy
_Note: Logic dictates Cumulative Weights must be unique!_

```python
from Fortuna import CumulativeWeightedChoice


cumulative_weighted_choice = CumulativeWeightedChoice([
    (7, "Apple"),
    (11, "Banana"),
    (13, "Cherry"),
    (23, "Grape"),
    (26, "Lime"),
    (30, "Orange"),
])

cumulative_weighted_choice()  # returns a weighted random value
```


##### Relative Weight Strategy
Relative weights work just like cumulative weights, except each weight is comparable to the others.


```python
from Fortuna import RelativeWeightedChoice


relative_weighted_choice = RelativeWeightedChoice([
    (7, "Apple"),
    (4, "Banana"),
    (2, "Cherry"),
    (10, "Grape"),
    (3, "Lime"),
    (4, "Orange"),
])

relative_weighted_choice()  # returns a weighted random value
```


#### CatWalk
CatWalk wraps a two dimensional sequence of values, the data is modeled as the surface of a torus or donut. When called, the algorithm randomly walks to an adjacent position and returns the value. CatWalk will move; up, down, forward, backward or diagonally in the data set. It will never fall off the edge, instead it will wrap to the other side.

Each sequence inside a CatWalk must be of equal length and must not be empty.

CatWalk produces a uniform distribution.

Flatten: CatWalk will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are not called. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.


```python
from Fortuna import CatWalk


cat_walk = CatWalk([
    (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15),
    (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25),
    (30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35),
])

cat_walk()      # walks to a new node and returns the value.
```


### Dictionary Wrappers
#### FlexCat
FlexCat wraps a dictionary of sequences. When the primary method is called it returns a random value from one of the sequences. It takes two optional keyword arguments to specify the algorithms used to make random selections.

By default, FlexCat will use y_bias="front" and x_bias="cycle", this will make the top of the data structure geometrically more common than the bottom and cycle the sequences. This config is known as Top Cat, it produces a descending-step cycled distribution for the data. Many other combinations are possible (12 algorithms, 2 dimensions = 144 possible configurations).

FlexCat generally works best if all sequences in a set are sufficiently large and close to the same size, this is not enforced. Values in a shorter sequence will naturally be more common, since probability balancing between categories is not considered. For example: in a flat/flat set where it might be expected that all values have equal probability (and they would, given sequences with equal length). However, values in a sequence half the size of the others in the set would have exactly double the probability of the other items. This effect scales with the size delta and affects all nine methods. Cross category balancing might be considered for a future release.

Flatten: FlexCat will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.

    "Cat_C": ("C1", "C2", "C3", "C4", "C5"),
}, y_bias="front", x_bias="cycle")

flex_cat()          # returns a random value from a random category
flex_cat("Cat_A")   # returns a random value from "Cat_A"
flex_cat("Cat_B")   #                             "Cat_B"
flex_cat("Cat_C")   #                             "Cat_C"

1. Definitions

  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
  pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
  arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
  phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
  other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
  including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
  work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
  the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
  musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
  timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
  Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
  encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
  other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
  which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
  constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
  entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
  constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together
  are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection
  will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
  this License.

  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
  copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
  transfer of ownership.

  offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

  e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
  individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
  individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)
  in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and

  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights
in the Work as stated below:

  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
  Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
  including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
  label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
  original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work
  was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate
  "The original work has been modified.";

  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
  Collections; and,

  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set
forth in Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
  this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
  (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
  Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
  restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
  Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
  License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
  that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
  copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
  Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
  measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
  from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
  the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
  Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
  itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
  Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
  practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
  4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
  Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
  credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.

  b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
  in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
  advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for
  other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall
  not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage
  or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
  monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
  Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
  4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
  to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
  Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
  Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
  institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
  Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
  reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
  Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
  any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
  does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
  Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
  a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
  translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
  original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c)
  may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
  case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if
  a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
  appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent
  as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
  doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
  of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights
  under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
  connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
  and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
  without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
  Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

  d. For the avoidance of doubt:

    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
    which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
    licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
    right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
    granted under this License;

    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
    the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
    licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right
    to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
    under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use
    which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and
    otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
    compulsory licensing scheme; and,

    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
    royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
    member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
    schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
    under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
    noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

  e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
  otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
  Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
  Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
  action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
  Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
  (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
  this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
  distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
  to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or
  not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
  the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
  under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
  otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
  Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from
  You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
  provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
  licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
  License.

  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
  perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
  Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
  under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
  provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
  License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
  under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
  force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
  the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
  and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
  offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
  conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
  remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
  parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
  extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
  consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
  the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
  respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
  or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
  shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
  communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
  written agreement of the Licensor and You.

  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
  License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
  the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
  1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
  WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
  Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
  take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
  sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
  implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
  the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
  additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
  deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
  restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
