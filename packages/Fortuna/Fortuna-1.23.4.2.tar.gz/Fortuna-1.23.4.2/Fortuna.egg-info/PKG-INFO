Description: # Fortuna: Fast & Flexible Random Value Generators
        Fortuna replaces much of the functionality of Python's Random module, often achieving 10x better performance. However, the most interesting bits of Fortuna are found in the high-level abstractions like FlexCat, QuantumMonty and TruffleShuffle.
        
        The core functionality of Fortuna is based on the C++ `Random.h` implementation of the Mersenne Twister Algorithm by Makoto Matsumoto (松本 眞) and Takuji Nishimura (西村 拓士). Fortuna is not appropriate for cryptography of any kind. Fortuna is for games, data science, AI and experimental programming, not security.
        
        Fortuna is designed to employ hardware seeding exclusively, this allows the generator to be completely encapsulated at the binary level. The API offers no direct access to the generator itself. This makes Fortuna non-deterministic at the smallest scale and inappropriate for some projects. This is a design choice and could change in the future.
        
        Fortuna is designed, built and tested for MacOS X, it also happens to work out-of-the-box with many flavors of Linux and Unix.
        
        Console Installation: `$ pip install Fortuna` or download and build from source, if that's your thing. Installation on some platforms may require Cython, python3 dev tools, and a modern C++17 compiler. Cython is used for installation only when needed. Installing Fortuna on MacOS via pip should not require compilation.
        
        Fortuna is built for the default CPython implementation standard, other implementations may or may not support c-extensions like Fortuna. A pure Python version of Fortuna is included in the extras folder. The c-extension is roughly an order of magnitude faster in CPython than the pure Python version.

        ## Fortuna Random Functions
        ### Random Numbers
        `Fortuna.random_range(lo: int, hi: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [lo..hi] inclusive. Up to 15x faster than `random.randint()`. Flat uniform distribution.
        
        `Fortuna.random_below(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in the exclusive range [0..num) for positive values of num. Flat uniform distribution.
        
        `Fortuna.d(sides: int) -> int`. Represents a single die roll of a given size die. Returns a random integer in the range [1..sides]. Flat uniform distribution.
        
        `Fortuna.dice(rolls: int, sides: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [X..Y] where X = rolls and Y = rolls * sides. The return value represents the sum of multiple rolls of the same size die. Geometric distribution based on the number and size of the dice rolled. Complexity scales primarily with the number of rolls, not the size of the dice.
        
        `Fortuna.plus_or_minus(num: int) -> int`. Negative and positive input values of num will produce equivalent distributions. Returns a random integer in range [-num..num]. Flat uniform distribution.
        
        `Fortuna.plus_or_minus_linear(num: int) -> int`. Negative and positive input values of num will produce equivalent distributions. Returns a random integer in range [-num..num]. Zero peak geometric distribution, up triangle.
        
        `Fortuna.plus_or_minus_curve(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in the bounded range [-num..num]. Zero peak gaussian distribution, bounded stretched bell curve: mean = 0, variance = num / pi.
        
        `Fortuna.stretched_bell(num: int) -> int`. This is an unbounded plus_or_minus_curve. Returns a random integer with high probability (~98% +/-2%) to be in range [-num..num]. Zero peak gaussian distribution, unbounded stretched bell curve: mean = 0, variance = num / pi.
        
        `Fortuna.zero_flat(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Flat uniform distribution.
        
        `Fortuna.zero_cool(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Zero peak, geometric distribution, half triangle.
        
        `Fortuna.zero_extreme(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Zero peak, gaussian distribution, half bell curve: mean = 0, variance = num / pi.
        
        `Fortuna.max_cool(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Max peak (num), geometric distribution, half triangle.
        
        `Fortuna.max_extreme(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Max peak (num), gaussian distribution, half bell curve: mean = num, variance = num / pi.
        
        `Fortuna.mostly_middle(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Middle peak (num / 2), geometric distribution, up triangle. Ranges that span an even number of values will have two dominant values in the middle, this will guarantee that the probability distribution is always symmetrical.
        
        `Fortuna.mostly_center(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Middle peak (num / 2), gaussian distribution, bell curve: mean = num / 2, variance = num / pi.
        
        `Fortuna.random_float() -> float`. Returns a random double in range [0.0..1.0) exclusive.
        
        ### Random Truth
        `Fortuna.percent_true(num: int) -> bool`. Always returns False if num is 0 or less, always returns True if num is 100 or more. Any value of num in range [1..99] will produce True or False based on the value of num - the probability of True as a percentage.
        
        ### Random Sequence Values
        `Fortuna.random_value(arr) -> value`. Returns a random value from a sequence (list or tuple), uniform distribution, non-destructive. Up to 10x faster than random.choice().
        
        `Fortuna.pop_random_value(arr: list) -> value`. Returns and removes a random value from a sequence list, uniform distribution, destructive. Not included in the test suite due to it's destructive nature. This is the only destructive function in the module, use with care. It will raise an error if the list is empty.
        
        ### Random Table Values
        `Fortuna.cumulative_weighted_choice(table) -> value`. Core function for the WeightedChoice base class. Produces a custom distribution of values based on cumulative weights. Requires input format: `[(weight, value), ... ]` sorted in ascending order by weight. Weights must be unique positive integers. See WeightedChoice class for a more comprehensive solution that verifies and optimizes the table. Up to 15x faster than random.choices()
        
        ### Utility Functions
        `Fortuna.min_max(num: int, lo: int, hi: int) -> int`. Used to force a number in to the range [lo..hi]. Returns num if it is already in the proper range. Returns lo if num is less than lo. Returns hi if num is greater than hi.
        
        `Fortuna.analytic_continuation(func: staticmethod, num: int) -> int`. Used to map a positive only function to the negative number line for complete input domain coverage. The "C" version of this function is used throughout the Fortuna extension. The function to be analytically continued must take an integer as input and return an integer.
        
        `Fortuna.distribution_timer(func: staticmethod, call_sig=None, num_cycles=100000)`. The `func` arg is the callable object to be analyzed. `call_sig` is an optional label, this is useful for methods that don't have the `__qualname__` property. Optional arg `num_cycles` will set the total number invocations.
        
        `Fortuna.flatten(itm: object) -> object`. Flatten will recursively unpack callable objects. If itm is not callable - flatten will return it, otherwise it recursively calls itm() and returns the result. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state.
        
        `Fortuna.bind(func: staticmethod, *args, **kwargs) -> lambda`. Returns the passed function object and all arguments wrapped in a lambda for lazy evaluation.
        
        `Fortuna.n_samples(func: staticmethod, *args, n=10, **kwargs) -> list`. Returns a list of n values by calling `func(*args, **kwargs)` n times.
        
        `Fortuna.shuffle(arr: list) -> None`. Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm. More than an order of magnitude faster than random.shuffle().
        
        ## Fortuna Random Classes
        ### Sequence Wrappers
        #### Truffle Shuffle
        Returns a random value from the wrapped sequence.
        
        Produces a uniform distribution with a wide spread. Longer sequences will naturally push duplicates even farther apart. This behavior gives rise to output sequences that seem less mechanical than other random sequences.
        
        TruffleShuffle will recursively unpack callable objects in the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.
        
        - Constructor takes a copy of a sequence (list or tuple) of arbitrary values.
        - Values can be any Python object that can be passed around.
        - Features continuous smart micro-shuffling: The Truffle Shuffle.
        - Performance scales by some small fraction of the length of the input sequence.
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle
        
        
        truffle_shuffle = TruffleShuffle(["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"])
        truffle_shuffle()  # returns a random value, cycled uniform distribution.
        ```
        
        #### The Quantum Monty
        A set of strategies for producing random values from a sequence where the probability
        of each value is based on the monty you choose. For example: the mostly_front monty
        produces random values where the beginning of the sequence is geometrically more common than the back. The Quantum Monty Algorithm results from overlapping the probability waves of six of the other eight methods. The distribution it produces is a gentle curve with a bump in the middle.
        
        QuantumMonty instances can return a list of samples rather than just one value, control the length of the list via the optional n_samples argument. By default n_samples=1.
        
        QuantumMonty will recursively unpack callable objects in the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are not called. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.
        
        - Constructor takes a copy of a sequence (list or tuple) of arbitrary values.
        - Sequence length must be greater than three, best if ten or more.
        - Values can be any Python object that can be passed around... string, int, list, function etc.
        - Performance scales by some tiny fraction of the length of the sequence. Method scaling may vary slightly.
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import QuantumMonty
        
        
        quantum_monty = QuantumMonty(["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"])
        
        # Each of the following methods will return a random value from the sequence.
        quantum_monty.mostly_front()    # Mostly from the front of the list (geometric descending)
        quantum_monty.mostly_middle()   # Mostly from the middle of the list (geometric pyramid)
        quantum_monty.mostly_back()     # Mostly from the back of the list (geometric ascending)
        quantum_monty.mostly_first()    # Mostly from the very front of the list (stretched gaussian descending)
        quantum_monty.mostly_center()   # Mostly from the very center of the list (stretched gaussian bell curve)
        quantum_monty.mostly_last()     # Mostly from the very back of the list (stretched gaussian ascending)
        quantum_monty.quantum_monty()   # Quantum Monty Algorithm. Overlapping probability waves.
        quantum_monty.mostly_flat()     # Uniform flat distribution (see Fortuna.random_value if this is the only behavior you need.)
        quantum_monty.mostly_cycle()    # Cycled uniform flat distribution (see TruffleShuffle)
        ```
        
        #### RandomWalk
        RandomWalk wraps a sequence of values, the data is modeled as a continuous ring. The sequence must not be empty.
        When instantiated, RandomWalk will randomly pick a starting point.
        When called, the algorithm randomly walks to an adjacent position and returns the value.
        RandomWalk will move forward or backward in the data set and never fall off the edge, instead it will wrap to the other side.
        
        RandomWalk produces a uniform distribution.
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import RandomWalk
        
        
        random_walk = RandomWalk(["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"])
        random_walk()      # returns a random value from the table by randomly walking to an adjacent position.
        ```
        
        ### Table Wrappers
        #### Weighted Choice: Custom Rarity
        Two strategies for selecting random values from a sequence where rarity counts. Both produce a custom distribution of values based on the weights of the values. Up to 10x faster than random.choices()
        
        WeightedChoice instances can return a list of samples rather than just one value, control the length of the list via the optional n_samples argument. By default n_samples=1.
        
        WeightedChoice will recursively unpack callable objects in the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.
        
        - Constructor takes a copy of a sequence of weighted value pairs... `[(weight, value), ... ]`
        - Automatically optimizes the sequence for correctness and optimal call performance for large data sets.
        - The sequence must not be empty, and each pair must contain a weight and a value.
        - Weights must be positive integers.
        - Values can be any Python object that can be passed around... string, int, list, function etc.
        - Performance scales by some fraction of the length of the sequence.
        
        The following examples produce equivalent distributions with comparable performance.
        The choice to use one strategy over the other is purely about which one suits you or your data best. Relative weights are easier to understand at a glance. However, many RPG Treasure Tables map rather nicely to a cumulative weighted strategy.
        
        ##### Cumulative Weight Strategy
        _Note: Logic dictates Cumulative Weights must be unique!_
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import CumulativeWeightedChoice
        
        
        cumulative_weighted_choice = CumulativeWeightedChoice([
            (7, "Apple"),
            (11, "Banana"),
            (13, "Cherry"),
            (23, "Grape"),
            (26, "Lime"),
            (30, "Orange"),
        ])
        
        cumulative_weighted_choice()  # returns a weighted random value
        ```
        
        ##### Relative Weight Strategy
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import RelativeWeightedChoice
        
        
        relative_weighted_choice = RelativeWeightedChoice([
            (7, "Apple"),
            (4, "Banana"),
            (2, "Cherry"),
            (10, "Grape"),
            (3, "Lime"),
            (4, "Orange"),
        ])
        
        relative_weighted_choice()  # returns a weighted random value
        ```
        
        #### CatWalk
        CatWalk wraps a two dimensional sequence of values, the data is modeled as the surface of a torus or donut.
        When called, the algorithm randomly walks to an adjacent position and returns the value.
        CatWalk will move; up, down, forward, backward or diagonally in the data set. It will never fall off the edge, instead it will wrap to the other side.
        
        Each sequence inside a CatWalk must be of equal length and must not be empty.
        
        CatWalk produces a uniform distribution.
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import CatWalk
        
        
        cat_walk = CatWalk([
            (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15),
            (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25),
            (30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35),
        ])
        
        cat_walk()      # returns a random value from the table by randomly walking in the two dimensional plane.
        ```
        
        ### Dictionary Wrappers
        #### FlexCat
        FlexCat wraps a dictionary of sequences. When the primary method is called it returns a random value from one of the sequences. It takes two optional keyword arguments to specify the algorithms used to make random selections.
        
        By default, FlexCat will use y_bias="front" and x_bias="cycle", this will make the top of the data structure geometrically more common than the bottom and cycle the sequences. This config is known as Top Cat, it produces a descending-step cycled distribution for the data. Many other combinations are possible (9 algorithms, 2 dimensions = 81 configs).
        
        FlexCat requires a dict with at least three sequences with at least 3 values each. Even though the total value limit is much higher, data sets with more than one million values are not recommended for all platforms.
        
        FlexCat generally works best if all sequences in a set are sufficiently large and close to the same size, this is not enforced. Values in a shorter sequence will naturally be more common, since probability balancing between categories is not considered. For example: in a flat/flat set where it might be expected that all values have equal probability (and they would, given sequences with equal length). However, values in a sequence half the size of the others in the set would have exactly double the probability of the other items. This effect scales with the size delta and affects all nine methods. Cross category balancing might be considered for a future release.
        
        FlexCat instances can return a list of samples rather than just one value, control the length of the list via the optional n_samples argument. By default n_samples=1.
        
        FlexCat will recursively unpack callable objects in the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.

        ## Fortuna Development Log
        ##### Fortuna 1.23.4.2
        - Fixed some minor typos in the README.md file.
        
        ##### Fortuna 1.23.4.1
        - Fixed some minor typos in the test suite.
        
        ##### Fortuna 1.23.4.0
        - Fortuna is now Production/Stable!
        - Fortuna and Fortuna Pure now use the same test suite.
        
        ##### Fortuna 0.23.4, first release candidate.
        - RandomCycle, BlockCycle and TruffleShuffle have been refactored and combined into one class: TruffleShuffle.
        - QuantumMonty and FlexCat will now use the new TruffleShuffle for cycling.
        - Minor refactoring across the module.
        
        ##### Fortuna 0.23.3, internal
        - Function shuffle(arr: list) added.
        
        ##### Fortuna 0.23.2, internal
        - Simplified the plus_or_minus_curve(num: int) function, output will now always be bounded to the range [-num..num].
        - Function stretched_bell(num: int) added, this matches the previous behavior of an unbounded plus_or_minus_curve.
        
        ##### Fortuna 0.23.1, internal
        - Small bug fixes and general clean up.
        
        ##### Fortuna 0.23.0
        - The number of test cycles in the test suite has been reduced to 10,000 (down from 100,000). The performance of the pure python implementation and the c-extension are now directly comparable.

        - Fortuna 0.22.x may introduce breaking changes.
        - Function bind added.
        - Function n_samples added.
        
        ##### Fortuna 0.21.3

          phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
          other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
          including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
          work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
          the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
          musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
          timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
          Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
        
          b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
          encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
          other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
          which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
          constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
          entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
          constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together
          are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection
          will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
          this License.
        
          c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
          copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other

          scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
          expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
          writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
          dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in
          dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic

          Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
        
          b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
          including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
          label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
          original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work
          was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate
          "The original work has been modified.";
        
          c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
          Collections; and,
        
          d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
        
        The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
        or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
        modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
        media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
        by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set
        forth in Section 4(d).
        
        4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
        subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
        
          a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
          this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
          (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
          restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
          Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
          License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
          that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
          copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
          measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
          from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
          the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
          Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
          itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
          Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
          practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
          4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
          Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
          credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
        
          b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
          in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
          advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for
          other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall
          not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage
          or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
          monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
        
          c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
          Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
          4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
          to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
          Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
          Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
          institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
          Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
          reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
          Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
          any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
          does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
          Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
          a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
          translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
          original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c)
          may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
          case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if
          a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
          appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent
          as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
          doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
          of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights
          under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
          connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
          and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
          without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
          Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
        
          d. For the avoidance of doubt:
        
            i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
            right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
            granted under this License;
        
            ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
            the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right
            to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
            under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use
            which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and
            otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme; and,
        
            iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
            royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
            member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
            schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
            under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
            noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).
        
          e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
          otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
          Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
          Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
          action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
          Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
          (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
          this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
          distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
          to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or
          not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
          the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
          under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
          otherwise.
        
        5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
        
        UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
        THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
        CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
        DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
        DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
        6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
        IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
        SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
        OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
        THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        
        7. Termination
        
          a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
          automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
          Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from
          You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
          provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
          licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
          License.
        
          b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
          perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
          Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
          under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
          provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
          License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
          under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
          force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
        
        8. Miscellaneous
        
          a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
          the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
          and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
        
          b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
          offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
          conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
        
          c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
          applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
          remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
          extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
        
          d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
          consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
          the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
        
          e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
          respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
          or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
          shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
          communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
          written agreement of the Licensor and You.
        
          f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
          License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
          the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
          1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
          WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
          Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
          take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
          sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
          implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
          the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
          additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
          deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
          restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
