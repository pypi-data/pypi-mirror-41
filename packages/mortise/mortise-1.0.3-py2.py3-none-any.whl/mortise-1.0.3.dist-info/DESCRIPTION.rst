# Mortise - A python state machine framework

Mortise is a synchronous state machine library for event based
systems.

## Features

* Synchronous state-machine event handling
* No external dependencies
* Composable / Reusable state support via pushdown automata
* State timeout and retry limit support
* Directed exception handling + state transitions on exception
* State machine visualization (requires graphviz)

## Requirements

* Python >= 3.4
* GraphViz (Optional for state machine visualization)

## Examples

See the `examples` folder.
