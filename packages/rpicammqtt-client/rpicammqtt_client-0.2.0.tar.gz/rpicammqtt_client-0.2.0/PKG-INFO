Description: # rpi-cam-mqtt-client
        
        Client library to control a raspberry PI camera through MQTT.
        
        Provides high level methods to control a raspberry PI camera:
          - get_status
          - get_ptviews
          - is_active
          - is_ptview_available
          - is_recording
          - is_detecting_motion
          - set_camera_status
          - set_motion_detection_status
          - start_video
          - stop_video
          - take_picture
          - set_exposure_mode
          - set_pantilt
        
        The camera needs to have the RPi-Cam-Web-Interface installed and the MQTT agent running. Check `rpi-cam-mqtt` (https://gitlab.com/gbus/rpi-cam-mqtt) project for further details.
