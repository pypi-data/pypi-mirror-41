Description: # bumpemu
        This is a bump controller emulator for CellPro PowerLab 6 and 8 chargers.
        It allows you to use the CCS mobile app to control your charger over
        bluetooth low energy (BLE).
        
        To interface to the PowerLab with BLE, you need two pieces of hardware:
        
        [FUIM3 USB Adapter](http://www.usastore.revolectrix.com/Products_2/Cellpro-PowerLab-8-EC5-version_2/FUIM3_136)
        
        [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B072N3X39J)
        
        #### Pi Zero W Setup
        
        This controller emulator will run on the Pi Zero W. Follow the
        [instructions](https://www.canakit.com/quick-start/pi) for installing the
        Pi with the latest version of [Raspbian](http://raspbian.org).
        
        Once you have the Pi up and running, make sure everything is up to date:
        
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get upgrade
        
        Then install the required libraries:
        
            sudo apt-get install -y libusb-dev libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev libgirepository1.0-dev libcairo2-dev
        
        The Pi will come with `bluez` already installed, but it will probably be an
        older version. Version `5.45` has proven to work well so you will need to
        install it. Download it from [here](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.45.tar.xz).
        Then follow [these instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/install-bluez-on-the-raspberry-pi/installation)
        to install it. Make sure to do the step where you enable the experimental
        features.
        
        Install the PyGObject dependency:
        
            sudo pip3 install pycairo PyGObject --upgrade
        
        Finally, `bumpemu` can be installed using `pip`:
            
            sudo pip3 install bumpemu
