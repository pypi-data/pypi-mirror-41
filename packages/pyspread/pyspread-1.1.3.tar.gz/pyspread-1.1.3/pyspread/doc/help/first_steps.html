<h1>About this document</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    This document provides a quick overview over pyspread.
    Readers should have at least some experience with Python.
</p>


<h1>What is pyspread?</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread is a spreadsheet application that computes Python
    expressions in its cells.
    It is written in the programming language Python.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The core mission of pyspread is to be the most pythonic spreadsheet.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread does not follow the traditional spreadsheet approach.
    Cell functions that are known from conventional spreadsheets
    such as Excel, gnumeric or OpenOffice.org Calc are not supported.
    Instead, Python expressions are entered into the spreadsheet
    cells. Each cell returns a Python object. These objects can
    represent anything including lists or matrices.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread's approach is comparable to the spreadsheet Siag.
    However, Siag uses the programming language Scheme.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    At least basic knowledge of Python is required to
    effectively use pyspread.
    Pyspread provides a three dimensional grid that can comprise
    millions of rows, columns and tables. This is possible because
    a dictionary is used for storing all grid data. Note that
    tables with many filled cells may require considerable
    amounts of RAM.
</p>


<h1>Basic concepts</h1>


<h2>Python code as cell language</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread uses Python expressions in each cell.
    This is similar to typing expressions into the Python shell.
    The main difference is that cells are only executed
    when required e.g. for displaying results. There is no
    guaranteed execution order.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Python expressions are terms
    that Python evaluates to a result object.
    <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html">
        http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html</a>
    gives an overview to the different types of Python
    expressions.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread expects such Python
    expressions in its grid cells. Therefore<br>
    <code>1 + 1</code>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    is valid as is<br>
    <code>[i ** 2 for i in xrange(100) if i % 3]</code>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    However, statements such as<br>
    <code>print 2</code>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    or<br>
    <code>import math</code>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    are <strong>not</strong> valid in cells. However, in the macro editor,
    these statements are possible. Module imports should take place there.
</p>

<h2>Module import</h2>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since the import statement for importing Python modules
    is no expression, it cannot be used from within a cell.
    Module import from within a cell can be realized by
    calling the function __import__:<br>
    <code>&lt;module_name&gt; = __import__("&lt;module name&gt;")</code><br>
    This cell makes the module
    available from each other cell. Alternatively, a module
    can be imported via the macro editor with the import statement.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    There are modules, which
    cannot be imported from within a cell. One example is rpy2
    (rpy works well). The reason is that module initialization
    is stateful, i. e. certain statements have to be called in
    a specific order. Such modules can only be from the macro editor.
</p>

<h2>Variable assignment</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Besides Python expressions,
    one variable assignment is accepted within a cell. The
    assignment consists of one variable name at the start
    followed by "=" and a Python expression. The variable is
    considered as global. Therefore, it is accessible from
    other cells.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    For example<br>
    <code>a = 5 + 3</code>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    assigns 8 to the global
    variable a.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since only one assignment is
    possible,<br>
    <code>b = c = 4</code>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    is <strong style="font-weight: bold;">not</strong> valid in a
    pyspread cell. Note that pyspread does also not support +=, -= etc.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Evaluation order
    of cells is not guaranteed. Therefore, assigning a
    variable twice may result in unpredictable behavior of the
    spreadsheet.
</p>

<h2>Result strings in the grid</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Cells that contain a Python
    expression display the string representation of the result
    object that is returned from this expression.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Exceptions to this rule are:
</p>
<ul class="one_line_heading">
    <li>
        The None object that displays an empty string i. e. an
        empty cell instead. All empty cells also return None so
        that an empty grid appears empty.
    </li>
    <li>
        wx.Bitmap objects that are displayed as images
    </li>
    <li>
        matplotlib figure objects that are displayed as images
    </li>
    <li>
        Valid SVG figure strings are rendered in the cell (static bitmap).
    </li>
    <li>
        VLCPanel (Vlc video panel) objects (pyspread 1.1 or newer) launch a
        VLC video player instance inside the cell.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Absolute cell access</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The result objects, for
    which string representations are displayed in the grid,
    can be accessed from other cells (and from macros as well)
    via the __getitem__ method of the grid, where the grid
    object is globally accessible via the name S. For example<br>
    <code>S[3, 2, 1]</code><br>
    returns the result object
    from the cell in row 3, column 2, table 1. This type of
    access is called absolute because the targeted cell does
    not change when the code is copied to another cell similar
    to a call $A$1 in a common spreadsheet.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    In order to make referencing cells easier, a toggle button
    can be pressed when editing a cell. When it is toggled on, a
    selection is converted into its code representation at the
    cursor. Note that selection a cell is not enough. It has to
    be selected (blue background) so that you see the selection
    representing code.
</p>

<h2>Relative cell access</h2>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In order to access a cell
    relative to the current cell position, 3 variables X, Y
    and Z are provided that point to the row, the column and
    the table of the calling cell. The values stay the same
    for called cells. Therefore,<br>
    <code>S[X-1, Y+1, Z]</code><br>
    returns the result object of
    the cell that is in the same table two rows above and 1
    column right of the current cell. This type of access is
    called relative because the targeted cell changes when the
    code is copied to another cell similar to a call A1 in a
    common spreadsheet.
</p>

<h2>Slicing the grid</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Cell access can refer to
    multiple cells by slicing similar to slicing a matrix in
    numpy. Therefore, a slice object is used in the
    __getitem__ call. For example<br>
    <code>S[:3, 0, 0]</code><br>
    returns the first three rows
    of column 0 in table 0 and<br>
    <code>S[1:4:2, :2, -1]</code><br>
    returns row 1 and 3 and
    column 0 and 1 of the last table of the grid.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    The returned object is a
    numpy object array of the result objects. This object
    allows utilization of the numpy commands such as numpy.sum
    that address all array dimensions instead of only the
    outermost. For example<br>
    <code>numpy.sum(S[1:10, 2:4, 0])</code><br>
    sums up the results of all
    cells from 1, 2, 0 to 9, 3, 0 instead of summing each row,
    which Pythons sum function does.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    One disadvantage of this
    approach is that slicing results are not sparse as the
    grid itself and therefore consume memory for each cell.
    Therefore,<br>
    <code>S[:, :, :]</code><br>
    will lock up or even crash
    pyspread with a memory error if the grid size is too
    large.
</p>

<h2>Everything is accessible</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    All parts of pyspread are written in Python. Therefore, all
    objects can be accessed from within each cell. This is also the
    case for external modules.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    There are 5 convenient
    "magical" objects, which are merely syntactic sugar: S, X,
    Y and Z and nn.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    S is the grid data object.
    It is ultimately based on a dict. However, it consists of
    several layers on top. When indexing or slicing, it
    behaves similarly to a 3D numpy-array that returns result
    objects. When calling it (like a function) with a 3 tuple,
    it returns the cell code.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    X, Y and Z represent the
    current cell coordinates. When copied to another cell,
    these coordinates change accordingly. This approach allows
    relative addressing by adding the relative coordinates to
    X, Y or Z. Therefore, no special relative addressing
    methods are needed.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    nn is a function that
    flattens a numpy array and removes all objects that are
    None. This function makes special casing None for
    operations such as sum unnecessary. nn is provided in
    pyspread &gt;v.0.3.0.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    External modules are
    accessible from each cell. Unfortunately, Python's
    convenient import syntax</p>
    <pre>
        from xx import yy
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    is no expression. Therefore, the expression
    <pre>
        xx = __import__("xx")
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    has to be used.
    Alternatively, the import statement can be used from
    within the macro editor.
</p>


<h2>GPG based security</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since Python expressions are
    evaluated in pyspread, a pyspread spreadsheet is as
    powerful as any program. Therefore, it could harm the
    system or even send confidential data to third persons
    over the Internet.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Even though this is
    basically the case for all office applications, the easy
    access to such behavior makes precautions necessary. The
    idea in pyspread is that you - the user - are trustworthy
    and no-one else. If you save a file and if you have the
    Python gnupg interface installed then a signature is saved
    with it (suffix .pys.sig). Only you can re-open the file
    directly. If anyone else opens the file, it is displayed
    in safe mode, i.e. each cell displays the cell code and
    no cell code is evaluated. The user can approve the file.
    Afterwards, cell code is evaluated. When the user then
    saves the file, it is newly signed. Then it can be
    re-opened without safe mode.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Never approve foreign pys-files unless you have <strong>
    thoroughly checked each cell</strong>. One cell may delete you
    hard drive. And it is likely to be found somewhere in the
    middle of a million rows, a million tables and a million
    tabs. If unsure, inspect the pys-file. It is a bzip2-ed
    text file. You can read it. You can grep in it.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    It may also be a good idea to run pyspread (and any other
    office application) with a special user that has restricted
    privileges. If you like it even safer then a sandbox may
    be worth a thought.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Technically, signing is done
    with GPG. When starting pyspread the first time, no GPG key
    is present and saved files are not signed. In order to activate
    signing, you can generate or choose an existing key via
    File->Switch GPG key...
</p>


<h1>Current limitations</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    External libraries that set states in several steps (e.g. rpy2)
    may be hard to use because in pyspread cell execution order is
    <b>not</b> guaranteed. Such libraries should be used from within
    a macro.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    There is no selection rectangle for auto-filling cells. Some
    of this functionality is provided by repeating cell content
    when pasting into selections.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Execution of C code that is called from Python expressions
    cannot be interrupted or terminated if slow. C code means that
    creating very large integers cannot be interrupted while a for
    loop can. Since spreadsheet code is executed sequentially, such
    long running C code may block pyspread.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Cyclic dependencies of cells stop at maximum recursion depth.
    If there are many cyclic dependencies, this may slow down
    pyspread.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Loading and saving Excel and Open document format files is not feature
    complete. Data will be lost when saving a document
    as an xls or an ods file and loading it again.
</p>


<h1>The pyspread workplace</h1>


<h2>Starting and exiting pyspread</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    On Linux or *nix systems, type
    <pre>
        $ pyspread
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    from the command prompt. If you want to run pyspread without
    installation then cd into the pyspread directory and type
    <pre>
        $ pyspread.sh
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    On Windows, type
    <pre>
        &gt; pyspread.bat
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    in the command line or launch the file via the Windows Explorer
    (click or double click)
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    You can exit pyspread by closing the main window or by selecting
    File -&gt; Quit from the menu.
</p>


<h2>Pyspread main window</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The main window comprises the following components (see Figure):
</p>
<ul class="one_line_heading">
    <li>Title bar</li>
    <li>Menu</li>
    <li>Toolbars</li>
    <li>Entry line</li>
    <li>Insertion mode toggle button (enabled on *nix only)</li>
    <li>Table selector</li>
    <li>Table list</li>
    <li>Grid</li>
    <li>Status bar</li>
</ul>

             style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 154px;">
    </a>
</p>

<h2>Title bar</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When pyspread is started or a new spreadsheet is created then the
    title bar displays "pyspread". When a file is opened or saved
    then the filename is presented in front of " - pyspread".
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Whenever a spreadsheet is changed then  an askerisk "*" is
    displayed in front of the title bar text.
</p>


<h2>Main menu</h2>

<h3>File menu</h3>

<h4>New</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    An empty spreadsheet can be created by File -&gt; New. <br>
    A Dialog pops up, in which
    the size of the new spreadsheet grid can be entered. Note
    that even though sizes of several million rows or columns
    are possible, there is a limit that is imposed by
    wx.Python. Therefore, grids with more than 80 million rows
    and 30 million columns may show problems and
    instabilities.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    <a href="images/screenshot_new_dialog.png">

             style="border: 0px solid; border: 0px solid; width:
             200px; height: 141px;">
    </a>
</p>

<h4>Open</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Loading a spreadsheet from disk can be initiated with File
    -&gt; Open. Opening a file expects a file with the
    extension .pys. The file format is pyspread specific.<br>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Starting from v0.3.0 there
    is a second file format with the extension .pysu. It is
    identical to pys but for the file being uncompressed. This
    format can be beneficial when using pyspread in
    combination with file version control systems such as git.<br>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Excel xls and xlsx files can also be opened via File -&gt; Open if the
    Python module xlrd is installed.
    Cell content and cell attributes are retrieved.
    However, functions and macros are neither loaded nor converted.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Starting with v1.1, Opendocument format ods files can be opened via File -&gt; Open if the
    Python module odfpy is installed. In v1.1, only cell content is imported.
    Neither cell formats nor functions nor macros are loaded nor converted.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since pyspread files are
    ultimately Python programs, a file is opened in
    safe mode if
</p>

<ul class="one_line_heading">
    <li>it has not been previously signed by the
        current user on the current system or</li>
    <li>gnupg is not installed or not configured to use a key
        with an empty(!) password.</li>
</ul>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Safe mode means that
    the cell content is loaded and displayed in the grid.
    However, it is not executed, so that 2+2 remains 2+2 and
    is not computed into 4. You can leave safe mode with File
    -&gt; Approve.
</p>


<h4>Save</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    A spreadsheet can be stored to disk with File
    -&gt; Save.
    If a file is already opened, Save overwrites it directly.
    Otherwise, Save prompts for a filename.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When a file is saved and the Python module gnupg is installed
    (and configured with a key that has no password) then a
    signature is created in an additional file with the suffix
    .pys.sig. The signature is a PGP signature. When pyspread
    is started the first time for a user, a pgp key pair is
    crreated for the user pyspread_&lt;user-id&gt;. This key
    pair is used for signing pyspread save files. A correct
    signature file lets pyspread open a file without going
    into safe mode. Note that the save file is <span
    style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> encrypted in any
    way.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    The pys file format is a
    bzip2-ed Text file with the following structure (since
    version 0.2.0):
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    <code>
      [Pyspread save file version]<br>
      0.1<br>
      [shape]<br>
      1000 100 3<br>
      [grid]<br>
      7 22 0 'Testcode1'<br>
      8 9 0 'Testcode2'<br>

      [macros]<br>
      Macro text<br>
    </code>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the Python module xlwt is installed then pyspread can save
    the spreadsheet as Excel xls file.
    Cell attributes such as fonts and colors are preserved.
    Python expressions are exported as strings.
    Macros are not saved into the xls file.
</p>

<h4>Save As</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    File -&gt; Save As saves the spreadsheet as does File -&gt; Save.
    While Save overwrites files that are opened on pyspread directly,
    Save As always always prompts for a file name.
</p>

<h4>Import</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    With File -&gt; Import, a
    csv file can be imported. There are two import filters.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    "Tab-delimited text file" is
    fast but does not handle ill-formed data or special
    formats well. As the name suggests, only Tab delimited
    values are allowed.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    The other filter "Csv file"
    opens the CSV file import dialog. In this dialog, CSV
    import options can be set. Furthermore, target Python
    types can be specified, so that import of dates becomes
    possible. The grid of the import dialog only shows the
    first few rows of the csv files in order to give an
    impression how import data will look like in pyspread.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Importing a file always
    activates safe mode (when no signature file is created
    manually) because code in the CSV file might prove
    harmful.
</p>

    </a>
</p>

<h4>Export</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread can export spreadsheets to csv, pdf and svg files.
    Furthermore, if a chart cell is selected then pyspread offers to
    export this cell to svg, eps, ps, pdf or png files.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When exporting a csv file then a dialog is displayed,
    in which the format of the csv file may be specified.
    The start of the exported file is shown below the options.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    <a href="images/screenshot_csv_export.png">

    </a>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When exporting a spreadsheet to a pdf or svg file then a
    dailog opens, in which page orientation and size as well as
    the grid section to be exported can be chosen.
    If more than one table is chosen for a pdf file then a multiple
    page file is exported. For svg files only the last table
    will be visible.
</p>

    </a>
</p>

<h4>Approve file</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread cells contain
    Python code. Instead of a special purpose language, you
    enter code in a general purpose language. This code can do
    everything that the operating system allows. Normally,
    this is a lot.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Even though the situation
    differs little to common spreadsheet applications, the
    approach makes malicious attacks easy. Instead of knowing
    how to circumvent blocks of the domain specific language
    to make the computer do what you want, everything is
    straight forward.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In order to make working
    with pyspread as safe as possible, all save-files (pys
    files and pysu files) are signed by the current user with
    a gpg signature file. Only a user with a private key can
    open the file without approving it. That should ensure
    that when loading a pys file, only the code that a user
    has written him- or herself is executed. Pys files without
    a valid signatures are opened in safe mode, i. e. the code
    is displayed and not executed. However, it can be approved
    after inspection.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Please note that in version
    0.2.3 or higher, keys with passwords are no longer
    supported. Since gpg should only make sure that the file
    that you are trying to open is your own file,
    password-less key pairs should provide sufficient
    security.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Therefore, never approve
    foreign pys-files unless you have <strong>checked
    thoroughly each cell</strong>. One cell may delete you
    hard drive. And it is likely to be found somewhere in the
    middle of a million rows, a million tables and a million
    tabs. If unsure, inspect the pys-file. It is a bzip2-ed
    text file. You can read it. You can grep in it.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    It may also be a good idea
    to run pyspread with a special user that has restricted
    privileges.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    If you like it even safer
    then use a sandbox. Chroot may be a good idea. Qemu / kvm
    are also worth a thought.

<h4>Clear globals</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread lets you define globals from within cells via "=" as well as
    via the macro editor. Clear globals deletes all globals but the initial
    set. This option frees memory and also gets rid of any globals that are set
    via macros. Afterwards, you have to re-apply the macros in order to have
    them available from within the spreadsheet.
</p>

<h4>Page setup</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Page setup provides a dialog for printer page setup. Dialog content depends
    on the operating system. The settings are used for print preview and print.
</p>

<h4>Print preview</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When selecting print preview, a dialog box is shown, in which the
    spreadsheet extents (rows, columns and tables) that should be printed
    can be selected.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">

    </a>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    After pressing o.k., a second dialog window displays the print preview.
</p>

    </a>
</p>

<h4>Print</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Print prints the spreadsheet. First, a dialog similar to print preview
    is opened, in which the spreadsheet extents (rows, columns and tables)
    can be selected. After pressing o.k., a operation system specific
    print dialog is opened. This dialog provied an option to start printing.
</p>

<h4>Preferences...</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The preferences dialog allows changing:
</p>
<ul class="one_line_heading">
    <li>
        <b>Max. undo steps</b>:
        The maximum number of elementary steps
        that can be undone via Edit -&gt; Undo.
        Note that pressing one butoon may result in multiple
        elementary steps.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Grid rows</b>:
        Initial number of grid rows when pyspread is started
        without paramaters.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Grid columns</b>:
        Initial number of grid columns when pyspread is started
        without paramaters.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Grid tables</b>:
        Initial number of grid tables when pyspread is started
        without paramaters.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Max. result length</b>:
        If a results is displayed as a string (and not as e.g. a
        bitmap) then the string is truncated to the value given
        here. The string length consideerd is the number of
        Unicode characters.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Timeout</b>:
        If calculations for a cell exceed the time in
        seconds given here  then calculation is aborted.
        This does not work
        for Python functions that are C code, so e.g.
        2**99999999999999999 is <i>not</i> aborted.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Timer interval</b>:
        If View -&gt; Toggle periodic updates is activated then
        all frozen cells are updated in an interval. This interval
        in milliseconds is set here.
        The change takes effect the next time that View -&gt;
        Toggle periodic updates is activated.
        Too small values may lock up pyspread.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>GPG fingerprint</b>:
        If a GPG key has been selected then its id is displayed
        here. Entering a new, valid id of an existing key that
        is <i>not</i> password protected changes the GPG key
        similarly to File -&gt; Switch GPG key...
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Open filetype</b>:
        The default filetype that shall be opened with File -&gt; Open.
        This should be adapted when using pyspread collaboratively via
        git, where pysu files are preferrable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Save filetype</b>:
        The default filetype that shall be saved with File -&gt; Save or File -&gt; Save As.
        This should be adapted when using pyspread collaboratively via
        git, where pysu files are preferrable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Spell checker language</b>:
        Available since v1.1 if pyenchant is installed.
        The spellchecking language may be chosen, here. All installed language options are presented
        in the choice box. If a language that you need is misssing, please install it globally for pyenchant
        (e.g. via your operating system repository).

<p class="one_line_heading">
    On *nix, Pyspread stores its configuration in a file
    ~/.pyspreadrc <br>
    This file is created when pyspread is started the first time.
    Removing it resets configuration.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    On Windows, them same information is stored in the registry.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Initial configuration can be found in pyspread/src/config.py
</p>

<h4>Switch GPG key...</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread lets you sign your spreadsheets so that they do not have to be
    approved each time that they are opened. For this functionality, gnupg
    must be installed along with its Python bindings (python-gnupg).
    Furthermore, a GPG keypair must be created or chosen that has
    <b>no password</b>. Key choice and creation is dialog driven.
    Creating a new GPG may take some time depending on the machine.
</p>

<h4>Quit</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    File -&gt; Quit exits pyspread.
    If changes have been made to a new or loaded file then
    a dialog pops up and asks if the changes shall be saved.
</p>

<h3>Edit menu</h3>

<h4>Undo</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Most user actions in pyspread can be undone by Edit -&gt; Undo
    (Shortcut: &lt;Ctrl&gt; + Z). Exceptions are:
</p>

<ul class="one_line_heading">
  <li>
    Loading a file (empties undo list)
  </li>
  <li>
    Saving a file (ignored)
  </li>
  <li>
    Approving a file (ignored)
  </li>
  <li>
    Deleting global variables
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The undo list is limited.
    The limit can be set in the File -&gt; Preferences dialog.
</p>

<h4>Redo</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Undone steps can be redone with Edit -&gt; Redo
    (Shortcut: &lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;Ctrl&gt; + Z).
</p>

<h4>Cut</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Edit -&gt; Cut behaves like Edit -&gt; Copy and pressing the
    &lt;Del&gt; key afterwards, i.e. the current cell code is
    copied and the cell is deleted.
    If cells are selected then the operations are applied to all
    cells in the bounding box of the marked cells.
</p>

<h4>Copy</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Edit -&gt; Copy copies cell code of the current cell (the one
    with the cursor) is copied.
    If cells are selected then the
    copied set consists of the bounding box of the marked
    cells, i. e. the smallest box, in which all cells are
    situated. Cells that are not selected in that box are
    copied as if they were empty.
    The format of cells that are
    copied is tab separated Unicode.
</p>

<h4>Copy results</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Edit -&gt; Copy Results copies a string representation of
    the current cell's result object.
    If e.g. the cell code of the current cell is 4*"a" then
    aaaa is copied to the Clipboard.
    As in Edit -&gt; Copy,  if cells are selected then the
    copied set consists of the bounding box of the marked
    cells.
    Copy Results is useful, if for example results shall be copied
    into an external application.
</p>

<h4>Paste</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When pasting cells, these
    empty cells are pasted as well as the filled cells. That
    means that an unselected cell in a marked area will be
    pasted as empty cell.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Images can be inserted via
    copy and paste. This creates cell code, which contains a
    serialized string that represents the bitmap. The code can
    be of considerable size. Therefore, it is normally split
    into multiple lines. Line breaks inside a cell are ignored
    by pyspread. Therefore, each cell behaves like one line of
    Python code even if multiple lines are displayed in the
    cell editor.
</p>

<h4>Paste As</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Data can also be pasted with
    Paste As. The keyboard shortcut is &lt;Shift&gt; +
    &lt;Ctrl&gt; + V. A dialog appears, in which the target
    dimensionality can be specified. If the transpose box is checked
    then the data is
    transposed. With this feature, fine grained access to
    which target data object dimensions are pasted into single
    cells and which are distributed across cells.

    </a>
</p>

<h4>Select All</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Select All selects all cells of the current table.
    The keyboard shortcut is &lt;Crtl&gt; + A.
</p>


<h4>Find</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Cell code and cell results
    can be searched with &lt;Ctrl&gt; + F or using the menu
    with Edit -&gt; Find. The focus changes to the search
    toolbar, in which search queries can be entered. Pyspread
    allows searching contained text, word-wise contained text
    and regular expressions, which can be toggled in the
    search toolbar. Similarly upper and lower case sensitivity
    can be toggled via the search toolbar. More details are
    giveen in the Find toolbar section.
</p>

<h4>Replace</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Replacing is done via the
    Find &amp; Replace dialog that is accessible via
    &lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;Ctrl&gt; + F or via Edit -&gt;
    Replace... Strings that are found are replaced with the
    replace string. Note that replace only allows searching in
    cell code and not in results.
</p>

    </a>
</p>

<h4>Quote cell(s)</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Quote cells puts Unicode quotations around the cell code of
    each selected cell or the current cell if no selection is
    present. Quotations mean that the cell content is interpreted
    as a Python unicode object, i.e. u" is put before the start
    and " at the end of the cell code.
    The keyboard shortcut is &lt;Crtl&gt; + &lt;Enter&gt;.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Quotation is <i>not</i> done if
</p>
<ul class="one_line_heading">
    <li>there is no code in the cell or</li>
    <li>the character " appears in the code or</li>
    <li>
        the first and last character combination is any of:
        "", '', u', "
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sort ascending</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Sorts all rows of the current table accendingly
    according to the order of the
    cell result objects from the column of the current cell.
    Cells that return None are sorted last.
</p>

<h4>Sort descending</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Sorts all rows of the current table decendingly
    according to the order of the
    cell result objects from the column of the current cell.
    Cells that return None are sorted last.
</p>

<h4>Insert rows</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Inserts one row directly above the cursor if no selections are
    made.
    If selections are present, then the bounding box that covers all
    selected cells is calculated, and the number of rows of this
    bounding box is inserted above the bounding box.
</p>

<h4>Insert columns</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Inserts one column directly left of the cursor if no selections
    are made.
    If selections are present, then the bounding box that covers all
    selected cells is calculated, and the number of columns of this
    bounding box is inserted just left of the the bounding box.
</p>

<h4>Insert table</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Inserts one table directly before the current table and switches
    to this new table.
</p>

<h4>Delete rows</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Deletes the cursor row if no selections are made.
    If selections are present, then all rows in the bounding box
    that covers all selected cells are deleted.
</p>

<h4>Delete columns</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Deletes the cursor column if no selections are made.
    If selections are present, then all columns in the
    bounding box that covers all selected cells are deleted.
</p>

<h4>Delete table</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Deletes the current table.
</p>

<h4>Resize grid</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Changes the grid size. Similar to File -&gt; New, a dialog
    is shown, in which the new number of rows, columns and tables
    can be set. The grid size is changed accordingly. Cells that
    stay remain identical. Cells that are added are empty. Cells
    that are removed are deleted and cannot be accessed any more.
</p>

<h3>View menu </h3>

<h4>Fullscreen</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Toggles fullscreen mode, in which only the grid is visible on the screen.
    In fullscreen mode, the mouse wheel changes tables as if the mouse were
    in the table selection widget right to the entry line.
    &lt;F11&gt; acts as shortcut to the fullscreen mode toggle.

</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Fullscreen mode has been added so that interactive presentations can be
    shown with pyspread.

<h4>Toolbars</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Toolbars contains a sub menu, in which the different toolbars can
    be switched on and off.
</p>

<h4>Entry line</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Swiches the entry line on and off.
</p>

<h4>Table list</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Swiches the table list on the left side of the grid on and off.
    The table list was introduced in v1.1 in order to improve usability
    when using mice with poor wheels that jump over tables.
    Note that switching on the table list limits the maximum number of
    tables that pyspread supports to a few million tables depending on
    the platform.
</p>

<h4>Go to cell</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Go to cell opens a dialog, in which a cell can be specified via
    row, column and table. After pressing o.k., the specified cell
    becomes the current cell, and it is put into view on the grid.
    This involves switching to another grid table if necessary.
</p>

<h4>Check spelling</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Activates the spell checker for pyspread >=1.1 if pyenchant is
    installed. All cells with text results are checked in the currently
    active language that may be altered in the File &gt; Preferences
    dialog. Words that are unknown are marked with a red curly underline. 
</p>

<h4>Zoom in</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">

</p>

<h4>Zoom to fit</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    New in v1.1. Zooms the grid so that it fits into the screen.
    This also works in fullscreen mode with the &lt;F6&gt; shortcut key.
    Note that if the grid is too large, which is the case for standard
    grids on normal screens, nothing happens. For screen presentations,
    minimize the grid size.
</p>

<h4>Refresh selected cells</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Executes code of cells that are selected and frozen and updates
    their cell results in the grid. If no cell is selected then the
    current cell is refreshed. The shortcut for Refresh selected cells
    is &lt;F5&gt;.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    This action has <i>only</i> effects on cells that are frozen.
</p>

<h4>Toggle periodic updates</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Periodically executes code of cells that are frozen and updates
    their cell results in the grid. The period can be adjusted in the
    Preferences dialog: Set the desired period as "Timer interval"
    in seconds.

    New in v1.1. Pastes copied cell formats.
</p>

<h4>Font...</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Assigns a font including style and size to the current cell
    if no selection is present. If a selection is present, the font
    is assigned to each selected cell.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    The fonts are <strong style="font-weight: bold;">not</strong>
    stored within the pys file.
    Therefore, fonts have to be available at the
    target system when opening a pys file.
    Otherwise, the font is replaced by the default font.
</p>

<h4>Bold</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Bold toggles the current selection's cell font bold attribute.
    If no cell is selected, then the attribute is toggled for the
    current cell. The shortcut for Bold is &lt;Ctrl&gt; + B.

</p>

<h4>Markup</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Markup allows using pango markup for cell output formatting.
    This is useful for formatting only parts of a cell output.
    Any cell output is parsed for valid pango markup. If found
    then it is interpreted.

<h4>Justification</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Opens a sub-menu, in which cell justifications can be chosen from
    left, center and right. The chosen justification is applied
    to all cells in the current selection. If no cell is selected,
    then it is applied to the current cell.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Besides text output, justification also applied to bitmap and
    vector graphics that are displayed in the cell. Matplotlib
    charts are an exception: They are always stretched to cell
    limits and therefore ignore justification.
</p>

<h4>Alignment</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Opens a sub-menu, in which cell alignment can be chosen from
    top, center and bottom. The chosen alignment is applied
    to all cells in the current selection. If no cell is selected,
    then it is applied to the current cell.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Besides text output, alignment also applied to bitmap and
    vector graphics that are displayed in the cell. Matplotlib
    charts are an exception: They are always stretched to cell
    limits and therefore ignore alignment.
</p>

<h4>Rotation</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Opens a sub-menu, in which cell rotatation can be chosen from
    0, 90, 180 and 270 degree. The chosen rotatation is applied
    to all cells in the current selection. If no cell is selected,
    then it is applied to the current cell.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Besides text output, rotatation also applied to bitmap and
    vector graphics that are displayed in the cell. Matplotlib
    charts are an exception: They ignore cell rotation.
</p>

<h4><a name="frozen">Frozen</a></h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The frozen button (flurry button toggles the frozen attribute
    for the current cell (<i>not</i> the
    selection). Frozen cells are immediately executed once.
    Cell results are stored in a cache.
    Instead of re-evaluating the cell result each time that
    another cell is updated, frozen cells always display the
    old, stored result.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    The flurry button can only
    mark one cell at a time as frozen. The selection is
    ignored for this purpose. Only the cell at the cursor is
    frozen.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Frozen cells can be
    refreshed using the menu with View -&gt; Refresh Selected
    Cells or with &lt;F5&gt;. All selected cells are refreshed
    by this command.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Frozen cells can speed up
    spreadsheets with long running calculations. Furthermore,
    the number of callings of stateful functions can be
    controlled.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    While the frozen
    attribute is stored in the pys save-file, the frozen cell
    result cache is <strong>not</strong> saved.
</p>

<h4>Lock</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Lock toggles the current selection's cell lock attribute.
    If no cell is selected, then the current cell is locked.
    Locking means that the cell cannot be edited from within pyspread
    until it is unlocked again.
</p>

<h4>Merge cells</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Merge cells merge all cells that are in the bounding box of the
    current selection. If there is no selection the the current
    cell will be merged (with itself) or unmerged if already merged.
    Merged cells act as one. Output is shown for the top left cell,
    which stays intact upon a merge.
</p>

<h3>Macro menu</h3>

<h4>Macro list</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Macros can be edited from
    within the macro editor via Macro -&gt; Macro list
    (Figure). The editor allows editing a text file that is
    executed when the spreadsheet is opened or when its
    content is updated.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    <a href="images/screenshot_macros.png">
            <img alt="Macro editor" src="images/screenshot_macros_preview.png"
                 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 156px;">
    </a>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The Apply button executes the macro code.
    Output (including exceptions) are shown in the lower part of the
    macro editor.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The scope of macro execution
    is global. Therefore, all functions are directly
    accessible from each cell. For example, the function f
    that is displayed in the Figure can be called from a cell
    via f(). The result is the returned string "Hello World".


</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since cell evaluation order
    is not guaranteed in pyspread, macros can be used for
    operations that enforce state. One example for such
    operations are some module imports such as rpy2.
    Furthermore, algorithms that are too complex for a single
    cell can be written as a macro.
</p>

<h4>Load macro list</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Macros can be loaded from files. The file format is UTF-8.
    Basically, any pure Python file is acceptable.
    When loaded, the new file content is appended to existing
    macros.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since macros may be harmful, loading macros makes the pys
    file unapproved, i.e. before any further calcluations are done,
    the file has to be approved again via File -&gt; Approve file.
</p>

<h4>Save macro list</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Saves the macros in the macro editor to a file.
</p>

<h4>Insert bitmap...</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The "Insert bitmap" option
    in the Macros menu is Identical to the copy and paste
    functionality.
</p>

<h4>Link bitmap...</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since version 0.2.3, images can be displayed in cells.
    Each cell, which yields a wx.Bitmap object, displays the bitmap.
    For each cell that yields a valid SVG xml string, the SVG ist displayed.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Linking an image with the
    "Link bitmap" option in the Macros menu generates code
    that refers to an image on the file system. This method
    allows displaying high resolution images in a pyspread
    grid. Please not that the image path is currently
    absolute. You can replace it manually with a relative
    path.
</p>


<h4>Insert chart...</h4>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since version 0.2.3, pyspread can generate <a
    href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> charts.
    Each cell, which yields a matplotlib figure displays this
    figure. The bitmap is stretched to the cell's extents.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    The "Insert chart" option in
    the Macros menu provides an easy way of generating
    matplotlib figures. They generate code of a special class
    charts.ChartFigure that is provided by pyspread. This
    class subclasses the matplotlib Figure class. The subclass
    takes matplotlib arguments and creates a figure in one
    step. The dialog creates the code for doing that. It also
    parses any code starting with charts.ChartFigure and
    figures out, which choice had been made last time. This
    may very well fail if you changed the cell code manually.
    For further reference, the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html">matplotlib Web site</a> is recommended.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Note that pyspread cells display all types of matplotlib figures.
    The chart dialog just provides a convenient user to create and edit common
    chart types.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since version 0.4, six chart types are supported by the chart dialog:
    Plots, i.e. line charts, bar charts,
    histograms, box plots, pie charts and annotations. Note
    that pie charts cannot be combined with other chart type
    yet. Please suggest other chart types that you find usable
    by posting at <a href="mailto:pyspread-users@gna.org">pyspread-users@gna.org</a>.

</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    The chart dialog is designed as a fast to use graphical front-end for
    common matplotlib properties. Attributes correspond to matplotlib function
    properties. Each property is described in tooltips.
    The chart dialog consists of three parts (from left to right):
    The Axes panel, the Series panel and a Chart preview panel.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    <i>Axes panel</i>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    The Axes panel allows changing X and Y axes attributes. Other axes types
    such as Z axis in 3D charts are not supported by the chart dialog.
    The axes panel is structured into three sections: Axes, X-Axis and Y-Axis.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the first box, overall figure attributes can be set, which is title
    text, the title text font and color and id a legend is drawn. The text
    entry field for the title text accepts Python expressions, i.e. if you want
    a specific string to be displayed as the title, you have to quote the text.
    However, if you want a certain global variable of cell content to be
    displayed then you can enter the object name. Functions and operators are
    also allowed as long as they return a string or unicode like object.
    Note that this applies for all fields of the chart dialog unless otherwise
    specified.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the second box, X-axis attributes are specified. The X-axis label is
    provided again as a Python expression. Font and color can be specified.
    Next, X-axis scaling can be set to linear (no check) or logarithmic (check),
    and the X-axis grid can be turned on and off. If the X-axis shall display a
    date instead of values and if a datetime.date object is provided as input 
    for the x-axis values then the date format field should be filled with
    a strftime format string. Details about the format string are given in the
    tooltip. The ticks field accepts a list or a tuple of numbers or floats.
    At these locations, axis ticks are set when specified. If left empty, axis
    ticks are set automatically. The label field lets the user specify
    arbitrary text as label at a tick. Font and color of the labels can be
    specified here. The secondary ticks option allows ticks to be displayed
    on the opposide side of the chart, i.e. on the top as at the bottom.
    The outside, inside, both choice specifies, where the ticks are situated at
    the axis. Padding allows setting the distance between label text and axis.
    Size lets the user specify text size if no explicit labels are given in the
    labels field.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the third box, Y-axis attributes are specified. Attributes match those
    of the X-axis both in content and format with the exception of the date
    format field, which is not available for the Y-axis.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    <i>Series panel</i>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    The Series panel allows adding one or more series to the axes. In order to
    add a new series, click on the + tab at the bottom of the panel. A series
    is deleted with the x right of the tabs. You can switch between series by
    clicking on the respective tabs.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Each data series can be of a specific type that is chosen from the list
    that is on the left side of the Series panel. In version 1.0.3 there are
    eight series types: plot, bar, hist, boxplot, pie, annotate, contour and
    Sankey. Note that the series type names correspond to the respective
    matplotlib names. Other types of matplotlib series are not supported in
    the chart dialog. If such a need arises please post an e-mail to the
    mailing list <a href="mailto:pyspread-users@gna.org">
    pyspread-users@gna.org</a>.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    <i>Plot chart</i>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    When the plot chart type is selected then on the right panel, Data, Line
    and Marker boxes are displayed.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the Data box, a data label can be
    specified that appears in the legend if it is activated. The X field is
    optional. It has to be an iterable of the same length of Y and allows
    specifying the X values of each data point. In the Y field, Y values of
    each point are specified in an iterable.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the Line box, the line style chosen from solid, dashed, dash-dotted and
    frozen. Its width can be specified in points (integer values only) as well
    as its color. 
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the Marker box, the marker style for the actual data points may be 
    chosen from a range of 22 styles. The maerker size can be specified (integer
    values only) as well as its face and egde colors. The marker alpha value is
    set with a floating point value, where 1.0 is solid and 0.0 is fully 
    transparent.

    When the bar chart type is selected then on the right panel, Data and
    Bar boxes are displayed.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the Data box, a data label can be
    specified that appears in the legend if it is activated. The left 
    positions field is mandatory. It expects an iterable of left bar values
    that is as long as the bar heights iterable that defines the upper limits
    of the bars (not the bar lengths). The bar widths field expects either a 
    number that applies to all bars or an iterable so that specific bars may 
    have different widths.  The bar bottoms field is optional and defines the 
    lower limit of the bars. Similarly to the widths field, it allows entering a
    number or an iterable.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the Bar box, the bar fill and edge color can be chosen. Furthermore, an
    alpha value can be specified with a floating point value, where 1.0 is solid
    and 0.0 is fully transparent.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Note that while bar charts may be morte difficult to use than plot charts,
    they can be used in order to plot arbitrary rectangles, which makes them 
    also applicable for example to plot simple top down views on room layouts.

    In the Data box, a data label can be
    specified that appears in the legend if it is activated.
    The data series that has to be provided is an iterable of numerical values.
    Categorical values are <b>not</b> supported here because this is not 
    supported by matplotlib. Value tuples are also not supported.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the Histogram box, the number of bin can be specified as an integer
    value. If Normed is checked then the integral of the histogram will sum to
    1. If stacked is also True, the sum of the histograms is normalized to 1.
    If culumative is checked then then a histogram is computed where each bin
    gives the counts in that bin plus all bins for smaller values. The last bin
    gives the total number of datapoints. Furthermore, the histogram bar color 
    can be set. The alpha value can be specified with a floating point value, 
    where 1.0 is solid and 0.0 is fully transparent.

<h3>Find toolbar</h3>
<h4>Search textbox</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In this text editor, a search string can be entered.
    When the textbox is focused via menu, toolbar or
    via &lt;Ctrl&gt; + F then the prior text is selected.
    When entered via mouseclick, it is not selected.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Cells are searched when pressing the &lt;Enter&gt; key or by
    clicking on the magnifying glass icon in the left corner of the
    textbox. The search always starts at the current cell.
    If the search direction is down (standard setting) then the search
    advances down through the current column then through the next
    column to the right and so on. When the search reaches the end
    of the table, it continues with the first column of the
    next table. When it reaches the last table then it continues
    at the first column of the first table.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    For each non-empty cell, the cell code is searched, i.e.
    Python code of the cell is searched for occurrences of the search string.
    If there is no match then the string output of the result object,
    i.e. the result from the str method of the cell is searched.
    If either the code or the string output contains the search string
    then the cell is put into view and becomes the current cell.
    Furthermore, the text in the find textbox is selected.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When clicking on the downfacing triangle next to the magnifying glass
    icon in the textbox then a drop-down menu appears. The drop-down menu
    contains up to 10 recent search strings. When one of these search
    strings is selected, it replaces the current search string in the
    textbox.
</p>

<h4>Search direction</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Toggles the search direction between down and up.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the search direction
    is down, the search behaves as described in the section search textbox.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the search direction is up then the search instead advances up through
    the current column.
    It continues in the next column to the left. When at the top left cell
    of the table then it continues with the previous table. If it reaches
    cell [0, 0, 0] then it continues with the bottom right cell of the last
    table.
</p>

<h4>Case sensitive</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Toggles the search between case insensitive (standard, button not activated)
    and case sensitive (button activated).
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the search is case insensitive then both the search string and the searched
    string are lowercased before looking if the search string is contained in the
    searched string.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the search is case sensitive then the original strings are used.
</p>

<h4>Regular expression</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Toggles the search between standard search (button not activated)
    and regular expression search (button activated).
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the search is standard then the searched string is queried via Python's
    __contains__ method, i.e. as in "search_string in seaarched_string". This is
    the standard behavior.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the search is a regular expression search then Python's module "re"
    is invoked. The search string is treated as search pattern.
    The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html">
    Python documentation on the re module</a> provides an overview of how to
    build regular expressions. There are various help pages and tutorials
    on the Web that focus on use cases.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Note that regular expression searches can be significantly
    slower than standard searches.
</p>

<h4>Surrounded by whitespace</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Toggles the search between standard search (button not activated)
    and surrounded by whitespace search (button activated).
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the search is standard then any substring match inside
    the searched string counts as valid.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the search is a surrounded by whitespace search then the substring
    inside the searched string has to be preceeded and succeeded by a
    whitespace character. Otherwise, the substring does not count as
    occurrence.
</p>

<h3>Format toolbar</h3>
<h4>Text font</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Choice box that contains the fonts that are available on the system.
    On GTK platforms, the font names are displayed in the respective font.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If a font is selected then it is assigned to the current cell
    if no selection is present. If a selection is present then the font
    is assigned to each selected cell.
</p>

<h4>Text size (points)</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Choice box that contains a choice of font sizes.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If a font size is selected then it is assigned to the current cell
    if no selection is present. If a selection is present then the font
    is assigned to each selected cell.
</p>

<h4>Cell text rotation</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Toggle button that switches between 0&deg;, 90&deg;, 180&deg; and 270&deg;
    cell rotation. Pressing the text rotation button is
    equivalent to selecting
    an entry in the Format -&gt; Rotation sub-menu.
</p>

<h4>Justification</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Toggle button that switches between left, centered and right
    justification.
    Pressing the justification button is equivalent to selecting
    an entry in the Format -&gt; Justification sub-menu.
</p>

<h4>Alignment</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Toggle button that switches between top, center and bottom
    alignment.
    Pressing the alignment button is equivalent to selecting
    an entry in the Format -&gt; Alignment sub-menu.
</p>

<h4> <a name="border_choice_box">Border choice box</a></h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    When changing border color or width, the command affects the selection
    or -if no selection is present- the current cell. Since a cell has four
    borders, all borders are affected by default. The border choice box
    allows changing this behaviour by providing the following options:
</p>

<ul class="one_line_heading">
  <li>All borders: All borders are affected</li>
  <li>Left border: Only the left border of the smallest containing
      bounding box is affected. </li>
  <li>Right border: Only the right border of the smallest containing
      bounding box is affected.</li>
  <li>Top border: Only the top border of the smallest containing
      bounding box is affected.</li>
  <li>Bottom border: Only the bottom border of the smallest containing
      bounding box is affected.</li>
  <li>Outer borders: All outer borders of the smallest containing
      bounding box are affected.</li>
  <li>Top and bottom borders: Only the top and the bottom border of the
      smallest containing bounding box are affected.</li>
</ul>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Each selection other that All borders refers to the smallest bounding box
    that includes the current selection. This bounding box may include cells
    that are not selected. Therefore, cell borders of non-selected cells may be affected.
</p>

<h4>Border width</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Choice box that changes cell border widthes. The section
    <a href="#border_choice_box">Border choice box</a>
    explains, which borders are affected.
    There are 11 different border widths.
    The first width is 0, which means that no border is drawn.
</p>

<h4>Border line color</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Invokes a color choice dialog that changes cell border color. The section
    <a href="#border_choice_box">Border choice box</a>
    explains, which borders are affected.
    The border color is chosen as an RGB value. The color choice dialog may
    look different depending on the operating system.
</p>

<h4>Cell background</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Invokes a color choice dialog that changes cell background color for
    all selected cells or for the current cell if no cells are selected.
    The background color is chosen as an RGB value. The color choice dialog may
    look different depending on the operating system.
</p>

<h4>Text color</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Invokes a color choice dialog that changes the text color for
    all selected cells or for the current cell if no cells are selected.
    The text color is chosen as an RGB value. The color choice dialog may
    look different depending on the operating system.
</p>

<h4>Merge cells</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Merges cells that are in the smallest bounding box of the current selection.
    In a merge, all but the top left cells are emptied and the size of the top left
    cell is extended so that it includes all merged cells.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If the top left cell of the bounding box is already merged then the merged
    cells are unmerged and no merging takes place. This also takes place if there
    is no selection and the current cell is a merged cell.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    While it is posssible to create overöapping merged cells this is not recommended.
    It may result in loosing content of cells and will result in drawing errors.
</p>

<h3>Macro toolbar</h3>

<h3>Widget toolbar</h3>
<h4>Button like cell</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    When pressed, a text entry dialog is opened, in which the text for
    a button label can be entered. If no text is entered then no button is
    created. However, whitespace labels are possible to get "empty" buttons.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    After pressing Ok, the current cell shows a button with the entered label.
    The cell code of the cell now is executed only if the button cell is clicked.
    This behavior allows manually starting functions without resorting to the
    <a href="#frozen">frozen cell mechanism</a>.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    A button can be removed by making the buttoon cell the current cell and
    then pressing on the tool "Button like cell" again.
</p>

<h4>Video cell</h4>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    New in v1.1. Requires vlc-dev.
    Opens a dialog, in which a video file can be chosen.
    This video file is then played back with a vlc instance in the
    current cell. The video is always linked and not included in the
    pys file upon save. Playback can be started and stopped with the
    left mouse button. Sound volume can be adjusted with the mouse wheel.
    Multiple videos can be played back in parallel. Note that video
    playback is considered experimental.
</p>

<h2>Entry line</h2>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Code is entered into the grid cells via the entry line.
    Code can also be entered by selecting a cell and then typing
    into the appearing cell editor. Code
    is accepted and evaluated when &lt;Enter&gt; is
    pressed or when a new cell is selected.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When data shall be displayed as text, it has to be quoted so
    that the code represents a Python string. In order to make
    such data entry easier, quotation is automatically added if
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Enter&gt; is pressed after editing a cell.
    If multiple cells are selected then
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Enter&gt; quotes all selected cell.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When entering data in the entry line, pyspread &gt;=v0.3.0
    offers code completion and context help if the jedi package
    is installed. When &lt;Tab&gt; is pressed while typing, an
    unambiguous suggestion for the next characters is made.
    Furthermore, the entry line tooltip is changed so that it
    contains information about all found completions. The
    tooltip is truncated to 1000 characters.
</p>

<h2>Insertion mode toggle button</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    On GTK platforms, the insertion mode toggle button provides a
    convenient way of referencing cells with the mouse so that
    typing S[X+a,Y+b,Z] in many cases becomes unnecessary.
    Note that on Windows, this functionality is not available.
    Therefore, the toggle button is permanently disabled on Windows.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    When activating the insertion mode toggle button, make sure that
    the cursor in the entry line is at a possition at which you want
    to insert a cell reference. When the button is activated, the
    entry line and the grid editors are disabled, so that no cell
    code may be changed manually. Now, select all cells that you want
    to reference. Selections may be chossen by dragging a selection
    on the grid as well as with &lt;Ctrl&gt; + &lt;Left click&gt; on
    cells. Each time that a selection is chosen, i.e. the left button
    is clicked without pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;, a string that references
    to all selected cells is inserted into the text editor for the
    cell that was current when activating insertion mode.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Note that inserting two selections will normally result in invalid
    Python code. unless "+" is put between the expressions.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    For example, if you want to sum over three cell areas, you may write
    "sum()" into the entry line and place the cursor between the parentheses.
    Next you click on the insertion toggle button. While you keep &lt;Ctrl&gt;
    pressed all the time, you select one range and two cells individually.
    Then you press the insertion toggle button again.
    The resulting code may look like this:
    <pre>
        sum([S[key] for key in 
    </pre><pre>
		[(r, c, 0) for r in xrange(1, 5) 
    </pre><pre>
			for c in xrange(5, 7)] + 
    </pre><pre>
            [(9, 7, 0)] + 
    </pre><pre>
            [(11, 7, 0)] if S[key] is not None])
    </pre>
</p>
<h2>Table selector</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Tables can be switched by
    changing the number in the table selector that is
    situated right of the entry line directly above the grid.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    This can be achieved by
    either typing in a table number or by moving the mouse
    over the table switch textbox and then scrolling with the
    mouse wheel.
</p>

<h2>Grid</h2>

<h3>Changing cell content</h3>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    In order to change cell
    content, double-click on the cell or select the cell and
    edit the text in the entry line.
</p>

<h3>Deleting cell content</h3>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    A cell can be deleted by
    selecting it and pressing &lt;Del&gt;. This also works for
    selections.
</p>

<h3>Selecting cells</h3>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Cells can be selected by the following actions:
</p>

<ul class="one_line_heading">
  <li>
      Keeping the left mouse button pressed while over cells selects a block
  </li>
  <li>
      Pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;
      when left-clicking on cells selects these cells
      individually
  </li>
  <li>
      Clicking on row or
      column labels selects all cells of a row or column
  </li>
  <li>
      Clicking on the top-left
      label of the grid or pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt; + A selects
      all grid cells of the current table
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Only cells of the current
    table can be selected at any time. Switching tables
    switches cell selections to the new table, i.e. the same
    cells in the new table are selected and no cells of the
    old table are selected.
</p>

<h2>Status bar</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The status bar at the bottom of pyspread's main window
    displays feedback for many operations:
</p>
<ul class="one_line_heading">
    <li>
        If the mouse is positioned over a cell, the cell code
        is displayed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Long running activities such as open and save may show hints on
        how to abort them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Find actions show information about the cell, in which
        the last occurrence has been found.
    </li>
</ul>


<h1>Advanced topics</h1>


<h2>Cyclic references</h2>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Cyclic references are possible in pyspread. However,
    recursion depth is limited. Pyspread shows an error when
    the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.
    It is strongly advisable to only use cyclic references
    when either a frozen or a button cell interrupts the cycle.
    Otherwise, cyclic calculations may lock up pyspread.
</p>

<h2>Result stability</h2>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Result stability is not guaranteed when
    redefining global variables because
    execution order may be changed. This happens for when in
    large spreadsheets the result cache is full and cell
    results that are purged from the cache are re-evaluated.
</p>

<h2>Error handling</h2>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Cells that contain
    expressions that raise an exception return the error
    string.
</p>

<h2>Security annoyance when approving files in read only folders</h2>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If a pys file is situated in
    a folder without write and file creation access, the
    signature file cannot be created. Therefore, the file has
    to approved each time it is opened.
</p>

<h2>Handling large amounts of data</h2>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    While the pyspread main grid
    may be large, filling many cells may consume considerable
    amounts of memory. When handling large amounts of data,
    data that is loaded within one cell saves memory,
    Therefore, load all your data in a numpy array that is
    situated within a cell and work from there.
</p>

<h2>Substituting pivot tables</h2>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the examples directory, a Pivot table replacement is
    shown using list comprehensions.
</p>

<h2>Memory consumption for sheets with many matplotlib charts</h2>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    If there are hundreds of charts in a spreadsheet then
    pyspread can consume considerable amountss of memory.
    This is most obvious when printing or when creating PDF files.
    Be warned that 100 line charts in one spreadsheet table may require
    10 GB of RAM.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    One solution to this issue is to generate an SVG image
    from each chart and insert it into the spreadsheet. <br>
