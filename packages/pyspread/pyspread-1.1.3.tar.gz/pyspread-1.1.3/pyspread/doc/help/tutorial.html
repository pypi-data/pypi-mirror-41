<h1>Running pyspread</h1>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Run pyspread with
    <pre>
        $ pyspread
     </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Select the Menu File &rarr; New<br>
    Enter 200 rows, 10 columns and 5 tables in the pop-up menu.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    <img alt="image:Tutorial1.png" border="0" src="images/Tutorial1.png">
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    After clicking OK, you get a new table with the typed-in dimensions.
</p>


<h1>Standard cell commands</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    Select the top-left cell and type:
    <pre>
        1 + 5 * 2
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The spreadsheet evaluates this Python statement and displays the result:
    <pre>
        11
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the cell that is one row below (cell (1, 0, 0)), type
    <pre>
        S
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    As we see from the result, S is a known object. In fact, it is the grid
    object that we are currently working in.
</p>


<h1>Absolute addressing of cells</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    To access a cell, we can index the grid. Replace S with
    <pre>
        S[0, 0, 0]
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    and the same result as in the top-left cell that has the index (0, 0, 0) is
    displayed.
    The first index is the row, the second parameter is the column and the third
    parameter is the table.<br>
    Now replace the expression in the top-left cell by
    <pre>
        1
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Both cells change immediately because all visible cells are updated.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    <img alt="image:Tutorial2.png" border="0" src="images/Tutorial2.png">
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The main grid S can be sliced, too.<br>
    Write into cell (3, 0, 0):
    <pre>
        S[:2, 0, 0]
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    It now displays [1 1], which is a list of the results of the cells in [:2, 0, 0].
</p>


<h1>Relative addressing of cells</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    Since cells are addressed via slicing, the cell content behaves similar to
    absolute addressing in other spreadsheets. In order to achieve relative
    addressing, three magic variables X (row), Y (column) and Z (table) are
    used.<br>
    These magic variables correspond to the position of the current cell in the
    grid.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Change to table 2 by selecting 2 in the iconbar combobox.
    Type into cell (1, 2, 2):
    <pre>
        [X, Y, Z]
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The result is [1 2 2] as expected. Now copy the cell (Crtl-C) and paste it
    into the next lower cell (Ctrl-V). [2 2 2] is displayed. Therefore,
    relative addressing is achieved. Note that if cells are called from
    within other cells, the innermost cell is considered the current cell and its
    position is returned.
</p>


<h1>Filling cells</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    The easiest method for filling cells with sequences is setting up an initial
    value and a function that calculates the next value.<br></p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Write into cell (1, 1, 2):
    <pre>
        0
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    and into cell (2, 1, 2):
    <pre>
        S[X-1, Y, Z] + 1
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Then copy cell (2, 1, 2), select the cells (3, 1, 2) to (99, 1, 2) and paste
    via &lt;Crtl&gt; + V. Now the cells (1, 1, 2) to (99, 1, 2) contain consecutive
    values.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Another way to fill cells is to create a list in one cell and use Edit -> Paste As... to
    distribute it into cells. Delete column 0 by selecting it and pressing the &lt;del&gt; key.
    Write into cell (0,0,2):
    <pre>
        range(99)
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    A list appears in this cell. Copy the <b>resulting list</b> with 
    &lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;Ctrl&gt; + C.
    (Make sure that you do not use the &lt;Ctrl&gt; + C command.
    This would copy the code, which results in an error message in the next step.)
    Move the cursor to cell (1,0,2) and press &lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;Ctrl&gt; + V.
    A dialog opens. Set 1 as object dimension. Do not check transpose. Press Ok.
    The cells are filled again. Finally, delete cell (0,0,0).
</p>


<h1>Named cells</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    Cells can be named by preceding the Python expression with "&lt;name&gt; =".
    Type into cell (2, 4, 2):
    <pre>
        a = 3 * 5
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    and in cell (3, 4, 2):
    <pre>
        a ** 2
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The results 15 and 225 appear. a is globally available in all cells.
</p>


<h1>External modules</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    External modules can be imported into pyspread. Therefore, powerful types
    and manipulation methods are available.<br>
    Type into cell (5, 2, 2):
    <pre>
        fractions = __import__("fractions")
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    &lt;module 'fractions' etc. is displayed. Now we redefine the rational
    number object in cell (6, 2, 2) in order to reduce typing and type in two
    rationals in the next two cells:
    <pre>
        p = fractions.Fraction("1/37")
    </pre>
    <pre>
        q = fractions.Fraction("1/37")
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The results 1/37 and 229 / 13 appear.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    In the next cell (9, 2, 2) type:
    <pre>
        S[X - 2, Y, Z] + S[X - 1, Y, Z]
    </pre>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    The result is 8486/481.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">

</p>


<h1>Working with cells</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    Summing up cells:<br>
    The sum function sums up cell values. Enter into cell (16,2,2):
    <pre>
        sum(S[1:10,1,2])
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    yields 36 as expected.
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    However, if there are more columns (or tables) to sum up, each row is summed
    up individually. Therefore, copying the data to column 0 and changing the cell
    (16,2,2) to
    <pre>
        sum(S[1:10,0:2,2])
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    yields [36 36].
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    If everything shall be summed, the numpy.sum function has to be used:
    <pre>
        numpy.sum(S[1:10,0:2,2])
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    yields 72.
</p>


<h1>Plotting</h1>


<p class="one_line_heading">
    Pyspread renders a plot in any cell that returns a matplotlib
    figure. Merging the cell with other cells can increase plot size. In order to
    make generating plots easier, a chart dialog has been added to the Macros menu.
    This chart dialog generates a formula for the current cell. This formula uses a
    pyspread specific function that returns a matplotlib figure. You can use the
    object S inside the chart dialog window.

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Switch to table 3.<br>
    Type into cell (0,0,3):
    <pre>
        math=__import__("math")
    </pre>
</p>

<p class="one_line_heading">
    Type into cell (1, 0, 3):
    <pre>
        numpy.arange(0.0, 10.0, 0.1)
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Create the y value list in cell (2, 0, 3):
    <pre>
        [math.sin(x) for x in S[1, 0, 3]]
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    Move the cursor to cell (2,2,3).<br>
    Now open the chart dialog window and enter
    <pre>
        S[1, 0, 3]
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    for x values and
    <pre>
        S[2, 0, 3]
    </pre>
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
    for y values. A figure is displayed inside the dialog. Press Ok and a tiny
    figure is drawn inside the current cell. It scales with cell size.
    Increase cell sized by selecting the cells (2,2,3) to (12,5,3) and
    select press Format -> Merge cells.
