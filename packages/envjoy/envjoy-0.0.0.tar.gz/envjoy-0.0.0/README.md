*A more enjoyable environment variable getter and setter - for Python.*

## Introduction

Environment variable getting and setting has a bit of an itch it. This is a not-so-whiny library that makes it more easy to get and set environment variables, and optionally smarter data type interpretation.


## Install

Install using **pip**:

```sh
$ pip install envjoy
```


## Use

Very basic **[example](https://github.com/grimen/python-mybad/tree/master/examples/basic.py)**:

```python
TODO
```


## Test

Clone down source code:

```sh
$ make install
```

Run **colorful tests**, with only native environment (dependency sandboxing up to you):

```sh
$ make test
```

Run **less colorful tests**, with **multi-environment** (using **tox**):

```sh
$ make test-tox
```


## About

This project was mainly initiated - in lack of solid existing alternatives - to be used at our work at **[Markable.ai](https://markable.ai)** to have common code conventions between various programming environments where **Python** (research, CV, AI) is heavily used.
