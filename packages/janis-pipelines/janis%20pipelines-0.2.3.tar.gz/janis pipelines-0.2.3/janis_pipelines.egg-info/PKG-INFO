        ## Quickstart
        
        Install through PIP ([project page](https://pypi.org/project/janis-pipelines/)):
        ```
        pip install janis-pipelines
        ```

        ___
        OR
        
        Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/janis):
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/janis.git
        ```
        
        
        ## About
        
        This project was produced as part of the Portable Pipelines Project in partnership with:
        - [Melbourne Bioinformatics (University of Melbourne) ](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/)
        - [Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre](https://www.petermac.org/)
        - [Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) ](https://www.wehi.edu.au/)

        ## Usage
        
        You must import `janis` into your project, that is:
        ```python
        import janis as j
        ``` 
        
        ### Included definitions
        
        Some unix tools have been wrapped and included as part of the pip module. They are located at `janis.unix.tools/`.
        The examples will use the included unix tools, with more information about bioinformatics tools down below. 
        See the section about contributions if you find an error in the tool definitions.
        
        ### Creating workflows
        
        A Workflow consists of inputs, outputs and steps (which each have their own tool).
        You can connect these components together with edges. Let's look the simple untar workflow.
        
        ```python
        import janis as j
        from janis.unix.tools.echo import Echo 
        
        w = j.Workflow("workflow_identifier")
        
        inp = j.Input("input_identifier", p.String())
        step = j.Step("step_identifier", Echo())
        outp = j.Output("output_identifier")
        
        w.add_pipe(inp, step, outp)
        
        # Will print the CWL, input file and relevant tools to the console
        w.dump_cwl(to_disk=False)
        ```
        
        
        ## Bioinformatics tools and data types
        
        _Coming soon_
        
        A repository of bioinformatic tools will be build to use within this pipeline. 
        The git submodule is embedded here for reference, but can also be found here: [here](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/pipelines-bioinformatics).
        
        ### Intended usage
        
        _Not yet available_
        ```
        pip install portable-pipeline-bioinformatics
        ```
        
        
        ## Contributions
        
        Contributions are the bread and butter of open source, and we welcome contributions. 
        All sections of this module are written in Python, however a fair understanding of Workflows, CWL or WDL 
        might be required to make changes.
        
        If you find an issue with Pipeline related functionality, please report it through the 
        [Github issues page](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/janis/issues).
        
        If you find an issue with the tool definitions, please see the relevant issue page:

        ### Releasing Portable Pipelines
        
        Currently the release process is manual. The intent is to run this project through a continuous integration 
        system for automatic releases on passing commits to master.
        
        To release, increment the version in `setup.py`, run the following command to generate the release binary
        ```
        python setup.py bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        To complete the upload, you will need to install `twine` and have your Pip settings configured:
        
        ```
        python -m twine upload dist/janis_pipelines-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl
        ``` 
        
        And that's it!
