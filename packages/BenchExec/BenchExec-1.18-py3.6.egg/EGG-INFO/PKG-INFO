        **News**:
        
        -  BenchExec 1.16 adds `energy
           measurements <https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/blob/master/doc/resources.md#energy>`__
           if the tool
           `cpu-energy-meter <https://github.com/sosy-lab/cpu-energy-meter>`__
           is installed on the system.
        -  An extended version of our paper on BenchExec and its background gets
           published in
           `STTT <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y>`__,
           you can now read the preprint of `Reliable Benchmarking: Requirements
           and
           Solutions <https://www.sosy-lab.org/~dbeyer/Publications/2017-STTT.Reliable_Benchmarking_Requirements_and_Solutions.pdf>`__.
           In addition to the `previous version from
           SPIN'15 <https://www.sosy-lab.org/~dbeyer/Publications/2015-SPIN.Benchmarking_and_Resource_Measurement.pdf>`__,
           it also describes the container mode and how to present result data.
           We also provide a set of `overview
           slides <https://www.sosy-lab.org/research/prs/Current_ReliableBenchmarking.pdf>`__.
        -  BenchExec 1.9 adds a `container
           mode <https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/blob/master/doc/container.md>`__
           that isolates each run from the host system and from other runs
           (disabled by now, will become default in BenchExec 2.0).
        
        BenchExec provides three major features:
        
        -  execution of arbitrary commands with precise and reliable measurement
           and limitation of resource usage (e.g., CPU time and memory), and
           isolation against other running processes
        -  an easy way to define benchmarks with specific tool configurations
           and resource limits, and automatically executing them on large sets
           of input files
        -  generation of interactive tables and plots for the results
        
        Contrary to other benchmarking frameworks, it is able to reliably
        measure and limit resource usage of the benchmarked tool even if it
        spawns subprocesses. In order to achieve this, it uses the `cgroups
        feature <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/cgroups.txt>`__
        of the Linux kernel to correctly handle groups of processes. For proper
        isolation of the benchmarks, it uses (if available) Linux `user
        namespaces <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html>`__
        and an `overlay
        filesystem <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt>`__
        to create a
        `container <https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/blob/master/doc/container.md>`__
        that restricts interference of the executed tool with the benchmarking
        host. BenchExec is intended for benchmarking non-interactive tools on
        Linux systems. It measures CPU time, wall time, and memory usage of a
        tool, and allows to specify limits for these resources. It also allows
        to limit the CPU cores and (on NUMA systems) memory regions, and the
        container mode allows to restrict filesystem and network access. In
        addition to measuring resource usage, BenchExec can verify that the
        result of the tool was as expected, and extract further statistical data
        from the output. Results from multiple runs can be combined into CSV and
        interactive HTML tables, of which the latter provide scatter and
        quantile plots (have a look at our `demo
        table <https://sosy-lab.github.io/benchexec/example-table/svcomp-simple-cbmc-cpachecker.table.html>`__).
        
        BenchExec works only on Linux and needs a one-time setup of cgroups by
        the machine's administrator. The actual benchmarking can be done by any
        user and does not need root access.
        
        BenchExec was originally developed for use with the software
        verification framework `CPAchecker <https://cpachecker.sosy-lab.org>`__
        and is now developed as an independent project at the `Software Systems
        Lab <https://www.sosy-lab.org>`__ of the `Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität
        München (LMU Munich) <https://www.uni-muenchen.de>`__.

        Users of BenchExec
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        BenchExec was successfully used for benchmarking in all seven instances
        of the `International Competition on Software
        Verification <https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org>`__ (2012-2018) with a wide
        variety of benchmarked tools and hundreds of thousands benchmark runs.
        
        The developers of the following tools use BenchExec:
        
        -  `CPAchecker <https://cpachecker.sosy-lab.org>`__, also for regression
           testing
        -  `SMACK <https://github.com/smackers/smack>`__
        -  `StarExec <https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/about.jsp>`__
           (`GitHub <https://github.com/StarExec/StarExec>`__)
