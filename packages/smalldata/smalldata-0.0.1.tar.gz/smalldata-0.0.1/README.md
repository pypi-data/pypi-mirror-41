# UNIX pipe fittings for statistics

In the quest for [command line data science](https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/data-science-at-the-command-line), 
this kit contains three command line utilities intended to be used in UNIX pipes.

## counter.py

Is a regular expression counter filter. Please see docstring for further help.

## groupby.py

Concatenates lines from stdin that match a regular expression. Please see docstring.

## extract.py

In the spirit of [RegExSerDe](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/contrib/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/contrib/serde2/RegexSerDe.java), this
tool uses regular expressions to generate a CSV file from a free-form text file.


## Other Useful Tools

If you've got CSV files, you should definitively check out [q](http://harelba.github.io/q/). 

## To Do

A cookbook would be nice. Showing how to analyze log files etc.
