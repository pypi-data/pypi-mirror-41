        ==========
        
        The goal of this code is to identify nodal features in potential
        landscapes, using a two-step approach:
        
        -  **Search:** Starting from a grid of starting points, find an initial
           set of nodal points by using a minimization scheme (Nelder-Mead). The
           initial set of nodes can be further refined by searching in their
           vicinity. This should produce a point cloud which lies densely within
           the nodal features to be discovered.
        -  **Identification:** Identify the features (points, lines, surfaces)
           which are contained in the point cloud. For this step, the nodal
           points are first separated into clusters. For each cluster, the
           dimension is estimated, and depending on the points are evaluated
           further.
        
        The initial use-case for this code is to find gapless features in
        three-dimensional materials.
