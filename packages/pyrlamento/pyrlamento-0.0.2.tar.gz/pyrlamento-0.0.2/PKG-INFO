        ==========
        
        Government information wrapper
        ******************************
        
        This library is an interface between your program and the various legal systems.
        It is still very very bare (only works with the portuguese Diário da República),
        yet its aim is to work seamlessly with other systems as needed.
        
        Ideally you'd specify the country and what you want, and you'd have it.
        
        This should eventually be able to retrieve
