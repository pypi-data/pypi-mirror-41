Attempt at a human-oriented abstract syntax tree (AST) parser/unparser for Python 3.

This package provides new AST node types which inherit from nodes in typed_ast.ast3 module.
Additionally, it provides implementation of parser and unparser for the extended ASTs.

Simple example of how to use this package:

.. code:: python

    from horast import parse, unparse

    tree = parse("""a = 1  # a equals one after this""")
    print(unparse())
    # this will print the code with original comment

More examples in `<examples.ipynb>`_.

technical details
-----------------

Parser is based on built-in tokenize module and typed_ast.ast3.parse() function.

Unparser is essentially an extension of Unparser class from typed_astunparse package.

Nodes provided and handled by horast are listed below.


Comment
~~~~~~~

Full line as well as end-of-line comments are parsed/unparsed correctly when they are outside
of multi-line expressions.

Currently, handling of comments within multi-line expressions is implemented only partially.


Docstring
~~~~~~~~~

To do.


requirements
------------

CPython >= 3.4.

Python libraries as specified in `<requirements.txt>`_.

Building and running tests additionally requires packages listed in `<test_requirements.txt>`_.
