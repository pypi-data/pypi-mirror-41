QxQFD requires the following Python packages:

 - Python 3.6
 - Pyquil 2.0.0
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - scikit-learn
 - networkx

QxQFD officially supports Linux 18.04.

Usage

QxQFD can be used with a Rigetti Forest QMI, or a local machine running the Forest SDK QVM.

Included with QxQFD are three demonstration notebooks providing examples of the library's use. They can be found in the
'demo' folder. The CIFAR-10 data required for the third notebook can be found at 
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.
