# CHANGELOG
The story begins at early february 2019

## 0.1
#### 0.1 - initial release
* supported arguments: positional, variadic and default 
* interfaces: `reproduction_string` function and `reproducible` decorator

#### 0.1.1 - minor improvements
* `reproduction_string` can take arbitrary instance and try to evaluate its *nice repr* at runtime
* project hosted on gitlab

## 0.2
#### 0.2 - slight interface change
* `reproduction_string` function renamed to `reproduction`
#### 0.2.1 - kitchen work
* package's readme back in `rst` format (less environmental mess)
