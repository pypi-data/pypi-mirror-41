    IDEA:
    Let c be a value (bytes) and P an EC point, then
    c, P -> h(P||c)G + P
    is a commitment operation. (G generator, || concatenation)
    The signature contains an EC point, thus it can become a commitment to c.

    HOW:
    when signing, generate a nonce (k) and compute a EC point (R = kG)
    instead of proceeding using (k,R), compute a value (e) that is a
    commitment to c:
    e = hash(R||c)
    substitute the nonce k with k+e and R with R+eG, and proceed signing
    in the standard way, using (k+e,R+eG).

    COMMITMENT VERIFICATION:
    the verifier can see W.x (W = R+eG) on the signature
    the signer (and committer) provides R and c
    the verifier checks that:
    W.x = (R+eG).x (with e = hash(R||c))
