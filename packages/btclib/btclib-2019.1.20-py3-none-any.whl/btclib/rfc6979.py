""" Deterministic generation of the ephemeral key following rfc6979

    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979:
    ECDSA and ECSSA need to produce, for each signature generation, a fresh
    random value (ephemeral key, hereafter designated as k). For effective
    security, k must be chosen randomly and uniformly from a set of modular
    integers, using a cryptographically secure process.  Even slight biases
    in that process may be turned into attacks on the signature schemes.

    The need for a cryptographically secure source of randomness proves
    to be a hindranceand and makes implementations harder to test. Moreover,
    reusing the same ephemeral key for a different message signed with the same
    private key reveal the private key!

    RFC6979 turns ECDSA into deterministic schemes by using a deterministic
    process for generating the "random" value k. The process fulfills the
    cryptographic characteristics in order to maintain the properties of
    verifiability and unforgeability expected from signature schemes; namely,
    for whoever does not know the signature private key, the mapping from input
    messages to the corresponding k values is computationally indistinguishable
    from what a randomly and uniformly chosen function (from the set of
    messages to the set of possible k values) would return.
