Description: 
        Basic Sums package
        ======================
        
        ``basicsusms`` is a package for computing structural sums and the effective conductivity of random composites.
        
        Structural sums (also known as basic sums) are mathematical objects originating from the computational materials science, considered to form a set of geometric features of data represented by points or disks on the plane.
