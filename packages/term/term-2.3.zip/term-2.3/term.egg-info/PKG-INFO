        An enhanced version of the tty module

        Overview
        ========
        
        The **term** package is an enhanced version of the standard library's
        tty_ module.
        It provides context managers for temporarily switching the terminal
        to *raw* or *cbreak* mode and allows to retrieve the cursor position
        without having to resort to curses.
        
        .. _tty: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tty.html
        
        Package Contents
        ================
        
        setraw(fd, when=TCSAFLUSH, min=1, time=0)
            Put the terminal in raw mode.
        
        setcbreak(fd, when=TCSAFLUSH, min=1, time=0)
            Put the terminal in cbreak mode.
        
        rawmode(fd, when=TCSAFLUSH, min=1, time=0)
            Context manager to put the terminal in raw mode.
        
        cbreakmode(fd, when=TCSAFLUSH, min=1, time=0)
            Context manager to put the terminal in cbreak mode.
        
        opentty(bufsize=1)
            Context manager returning an rw stream connected to /dev/tty.
            The stream is None if the device could not be opened.
        
        getyx()
            Return the cursor position as 1-based (line, col) tuple.
            Line and col are 0 if the device cannot be opened or the terminal
            does not support DSR 6.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        To resize the terminal window we enter cbreak mode and write the new
        dimensions to the tty::
        
            from term import opentty, cbreakmode
        
            with opentty() as tty:
                if tty is not None:
                    with cbreakmode(tty, min=0):
                        tty.write(b'\033[8;25;80t');
        
                    print('terminal resized')
        
        You may also want to look at the `source code`_ of getyx().

        Caveat
        ======
        
        The terminal must be in canonical mode before any of the functions and
        context managers can be used. They are not meant for switching between
        raw and cbreak modes. Nesting context managers of the same type is allowed
        though.
