        Slayer is the QA Automation Framework that came to SLAY!
        --------------------------------------------------------
        
        Slayer is a QA Automation Framework developed in Python, based on BDD.
        
        BDD, or Behavior Driven Development, is a software development process emerged from Test Driven Development (TDD).
        
        Besides following the practices of TDD, BDD provides an easy-to-understand vocabulary for developers and stakeholders.
        Having a common vocabulary helps both technical and non-technical members in an organization to better communicate and to create software with higher quality.
        
        This framework uses a lot of the functionality provided by the `Python Behave project <http://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
        
        Please go to the `Documentation <http://slayer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?>`_ for information on how to install, run and modify Slayer!
