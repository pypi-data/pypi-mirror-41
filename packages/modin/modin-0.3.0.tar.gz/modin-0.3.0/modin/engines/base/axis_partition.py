    """This abstract class represents the Parent class for any
        `ColumnPartition` or `RowPartition` class. This class is intended to
        simplify the way that operations are performed

        Note 0: The procedures that use this class and its methods assume that
            they have some global knowledge about the entire axis. This may
            require the implementation to use concatenation or append on the
            list of block partitions in this object.

        Note 1: The `BaseBlockPartitions` object that controls these objects
            (through the API exposed here) has an invariant that requires that
            this object is never returned from a function. It assumes that
            there will always be `BaseRemotePartition` object stored and structures
            itself accordingly.

        The only abstract method needed to implement is the `apply` method.

        Args:

                for the resulting object. It is up to this method to choose the
                splitting at this time.
