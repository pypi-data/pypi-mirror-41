#### Meta3C parameters

## Read processing

#Read size after trimming and filtering (both paired ends combined)
read_size=130
export read_size

## Assembly processing parameters

#Contigs below this threshold are discarded. This should not be normally smaller than $size_chunk_threshold.
size_contig_threshold=500
export size_contig_threshold

## Network generation parameters

#Default network name when partitioning
network_file=${network_dir}/network.txt
export network_file

#Contigs are virtually 'split' into fixed-length chunks: each chunk gets a separate node and label in the contact network.
chunk_size=1000
export chunk_size

#Contig tails below this threshold are discarded, while those above this threshold are treated as separate chunks.
size_chunk_threshold=500
export size_chunk_threshold

#Alignments below this mapping quality score are discarded.
mapping_quality_threshold=10
export mapping_quality_threshold

#Normalize contacts by their respective coverages
norm=0
export norm

## Louvain parameters

#Number of iterations of the Louvain algorithm to perform. This is one of the time and memory critical steps of the pipeline, so don't set this number higher than necessary.
iterations=300
export iterations

#Number of iterations to consider if for some reason you wish it to be lower than the total number of iterations
iter=${iterations}

#Number of bins to extract in size order (starting with the biggest)
n_bins=100

## Annotation parameters

#Minimum E-value for discarding matches of predicted proteins onto HMMs
evalue=1e-4
export evalue

#### Miscellaneous parameters

#Remove temporary files after each pipeline step
clean_up=0

#Number of threads to use
#threads=$(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo) #Only works on Linux
