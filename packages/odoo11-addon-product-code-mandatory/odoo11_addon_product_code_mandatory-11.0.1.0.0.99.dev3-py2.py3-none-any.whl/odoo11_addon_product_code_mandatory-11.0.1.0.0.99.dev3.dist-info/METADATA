======================
Product Code Mandatory
======================

This module sets the field internal reference (default_code) of the product
as required.

Usage
=====

* Unable to save a product with an empty or blank internal reference.
* When creating more than one product variant from the template, a variant will be created  
  with a default value for default_code field. 
* A pre_init_hook process is initiated when there exist records without an internal reference(default_code).
  A default value is generated to populate empty field as a temporary value.
