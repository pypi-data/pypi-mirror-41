# ## Load data and explore
# 
# This code snippet shows the typical process of starting with a raw data set, in this case the [data from Dominick's Finer Foods](https://research.chicagobooth.edu/kilts/marketing-databases/dominicks).  You can also use the convenience function [load_dominicks_oj_data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/ftk.data.dominicks_oj.load_dominicks_oj_data).

# In[3]:

# The data consist of weekly sales by brand and store. The logarithm of the quantity sold is in the _logmove_ column. The data also includes some customer demographic features. 
# 
# To model the time series, you need to extract the following elements from this dataframe: 
# + A date/time axis 
# + The sales quantity to be forecast

# In[4]:


# The sales are contained in the 'logmove' column. 
# Values are logarithmic, so exponentiate and round them to get quantity sold
def expround(x):

whole_df['Quantity'] = whole_df['logmove'].apply(expround)

# The time axis is in the 'week' column

# Create new datetime columns containing the start and end of each week period

# The data contains approximately 250 different combinations of store and brand in a data frame. Each combination defines its own time series of sales. 
# 
# You can use the [TimeSeriesDataFrame](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/ftk.time_series_data_frame.timeseriesdataframe)  class to conveniently model multiple series in a single data structure using the _grain_. The grain is specified by the `store` and `brand` columns.
# 
# The difference between _grain_ and _group_ is that grain is always physically meaningful in the real world, while group doesn't have to be. Internal package functions use group to build a single model from multiple time series if the user believes this grouping helps improve model performance. By default, group is set to be equal to grain, and a single model is built for each grain. 

# In[6]:

# ## Data preprocessing - impute missing values

# Start by splitting the data into training set and a testing set with the [last_n_periods_split](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/ftk.ts_utils) utility function. The resulting testing set contains the last 40 observations of each time series. 

# In[10]:


train_tsdf, test_tsdf = last_n_periods_split(whole_tsdf, 40)


# Basic time series models require contiguous time series. Check to see if the series are regular, meaning that they have a time index sampled at regular intervals, using the [check_regularity_by_grain](https://docs.microsoft.compython/api/ftk.time_series_data_frame.timeseriesdataframe#check-regularity-by-grain) function.

# In[11]:

print(ts_regularity[ts_regularity['regular'] == False])


# You can see that most of the series (213 out of 249) are irregular. An [imputation transform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/ftk.transforms.ts_imputer.timeseriesimputer) is required to fill in missing sales quantity values. While there are many imputation options, the following sample code uses a linear interpolation.

# In[12]:


# Use a TimeSeriesImputer to linearly interpolate missing values
imputer = TimeSeriesImputer(input_column='Quantity', 
                            option='interpolate',
                            method='linear',
                            freq='W-WED')

print(ts_regularity_imputed[ts_regularity_imputed['regular'] == False])


# ## Univariate Time Series Models
# 
# Now that you have cleaned up the data, you can begin modeling.  Start by creating three univariate models: the "naive" model, the "seasonal naive" model, and an "ARIMA" model.
# * The Naive forecasting algorithm uses the actual target variable value of the last period as the forecasted value of the current period.
# 
# * The Seasonal Naive algorithm uses the actual target variable value of the same time point of the previous season as the forecasted value of the current time point. Some examples include using the actual value of the same month of last year to forecast months of the current year; use the same hour of yesterday to forecast hours today. 
# 
# * The exponential smoothing (ETS) algorithm generates forecasts by computing the weighted averages of past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially as the observations get older. 
# 
# * The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) algorithm captures the autocorrelation in time series data. For more information about ARIMA, see [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)
# 
# Start by setting certain model parameters based on your data exploration. 

# In[14]:

# ### Initialize Models

# In[15]:


# Initialize naive model.
naive_model = Naive(freq=oj_series_freq)

# Initialize seasonal naive model. 
seasonal_naive_model = SeasonalNaive(freq=oj_series_freq, 
                                     seasonality=oj_series_seasonality)

# Initialize Exponential Smoothing model
# Don't allow multiplicative trend since it can lead to instability

# Initialize ARIMA(p,d,q) model.
arima_order = [2, 1, 0]
arima_model = Arima(oj_series_freq, arima_order)


# ### Combine Multiple Models
# 
# The [ForecasterUnion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/ftk.models.forecaster_union?view=azure-ml-py-latest) estimator allows you to combine multiple estimators and fit/predict on them using one line of code.

                     ('es', es_model), ('arima', arima_model)]) 


# ### Fit and Predict
# 
# The estimators in AMLPF follow the same API as scikit-learn estimators: a fit method for model training and a predict method for generating forecasts. 

# **Train models**  
# Since these models are all univariate models, one model is fit to each grain of the data. Using AMLPF, all 249 models can be fit with just one function call.

# In[17]:


forecaster_union_fitted = forecaster_union.fit(train_imputed_tsdf)


# **Forecast sales on test data**  
# Similar to the fit method, you can create predictions for all 249 series in the testing data set with one call to the `predict` function. 

# In[18]:


forecaster_union_prediction = forecaster_union_fitted.predict(test_tsdf, retain_feature_column=True)


# **Evaluate model performance**   
# 
# Now you can calculate the forecast errors on the test set. You can use the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) here. MAPE is the mean absolute percent error relative to the actual sales values. The ```calc_error``` function provides a few built-in functions for commonly used error metrics. You can also define our custom error function to calculate MedianAPE and pass it to the err_fun argument.

# ## Machine Learning Models
# 
# In addition to traditional univariate models, Azure Machine Learning Package for Forecasting also enables you to create machine learning models.
# 
# For these models, begin by creating features.

# ### Feature Engineering
# 
# **Transformers**   
# The package provides many transformers for time series data preprocessing and featurization. The examples that follow demonstrate some of the preprocessing and featurization functionality.

# In[21]:


# DropColumns: Drop columns that should not be included for modeling. `logmove` is the log of the number of 
# units sold, so providing this number would be cheating. `WeekFirstDay` would be 
# redundant since we already have a feature for the last day of the week.
columns_to_drop = ['logmove', 'WeekFirstDay', 'week']
column_dropper = DropColumns(columns_to_drop)

# TimeSeriesImputer: Fill missing values in the features
# First, we need to create a dictionary with key as column names and value as values used to fill missing 
# values for that column. We are going to use the mean to fill missing values for each column.
columns_with_missing_values = train_imputed_tsdf.columns[pd.DataFrame(train_imputed_tsdf).isnull().any()].tolist()
columns_with_missing_values = [c for c in columns_with_missing_values if c not in columns_to_drop]

for c in columns_with_missing_values:
    missing_value_imputation_dictionary[c] = train_imputed_tsdf[c].mean()
fillna_imputer = TimeSeriesImputer(option='fillna', 
                                   input_column=columns_with_missing_values,
                                   value=missing_value_imputation_dictionary)

# GrainIndexFeaturizer: create indicator variables for stores and brands
grain_featurizer = GrainIndexFeaturizer(overwrite_columns=True, ts_frequency=oj_series_freq)


# **Pipelines**   
# Pipeline objects make it easy to save a set of steps so they can be applied over and over again to different objects. Also, pipeline objects can be pickled to make them easily portable to other machines for deployment. You can chain all the transformers you've created so far using a pipeline.

# 
# The [RegressionForecaster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/ftk.models.regression_forecaster.regressionforecaster)  function wraps sklearn regression estimators so that they can be trained on TimeSeriesDataFrame. The wrapped forecaster also puts each group, in this case store, into the same model. The forecaster can learn one model for a group of series that were deemed similar and can be pooled together. One model for a group of series often uses the data from longer series to improve forecasts for short series. You can substitute these models for any other models in the library that support regression.

# Some machine learning models was able to take advantage of the added features and the similarities between series to get better forecast accuracy.

# ### Cross Validation and Parameter & Model Sweeping    
# 
# The package adapts some traditional machine learning functions for a forecasting application.  [RollingOriginValidator](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/ftk.model_selection.cross_validation.rollingoriginvalidator) does cross-validation temporally, respecting what would and would not be known in a forecasting framework. 
# 
# In the figure below, each square represents data from one time point. The blue squares represent training and orange squares represent testing in each fold. Testing data must come from the time points after the largest training time point. Otherwise, future data is leaked into training data causing the model evaluation to become invalid. 
# <img src="https://azuremlpackages.blob.core.windows.net/images/cv_figure.png">

# **Parameter Sweeping**  
# The [TSGridSearchCV](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/ftk.model_selection.search.tsgridsearchcv) class exhaustively searches over specified parameter values and uses `RollingOriginValidator` to evaluate parameter performance in order to find the best parameters.

# In[26]:


# Set up the `RollingOriginValidator` to do 2 folds of rolling origin cross-validation
rollcv = RollingOriginValidator(n_splits=2)
randomforest_model_for_cv = RegressionForecaster(estimator=RandomForestRegressor(),

# **Model Sweeping**  
# The `BestOfForecaster` class selects the model with the best performance from a list of given models. Similar to `TSGridSearchCV`, it also uses RollingOriginValidator for cross validation and performance evaluation.  
# Here we pass a list of two models to demonstrate the usage of `BestOfForecaster`

# ## Visualization
# The `ForecastDataFrame` class provides a few plotting functions for visualizing and analyzing forecasting results. Here we show a couple of mostly commonly used charts. Please see the sample notebook on plotting functions for all the functions available. 

# The `show_error` function plots performance metrics aggregated by an arbitrary column.By default, it aggregates by the `grain_colnames` of the `ForecastDataFrame`. It's often useful to identify the grains/groups with the best or worst performance, especially when you have a large number of time series. The `performance_percent` argument of `show_error` allows you to specify a performance interval and plot the error of a subset of grains/groups.

# Plot the grains with the bottom 5% performance, i.e. top 5% MedianAPE

# In[29]:


fig, ax = best_of_forecaster_prediction.show_error(err_name='MedianAPE', err_fun=calc_median_ape, performance_percent=(0.95, 1))


# Plot the grains with the top 5% performance, i.e. bottom 5% MedianAPE

# In[30]:


fig, ax = best_of_forecaster_prediction.show_error(err_name='MedianAPE', err_fun=calc_median_ape, performance_percent=(0, 0.05))


# Once you have an idea of the overall performance, you may want to explore individual grains, especially those performed poorly. The `plot_forecast_by_grain` method plots forecast vs. actual of specified grains. Here, we plot the grain with the best performance and the grain with the worst performance discovered in the `show_error` plot.

# In[31]:


fig_ax = best_of_forecaster_prediction.plot_forecast_by_grain(grains=[(33, 'tropicana'), (128, 'minute.maid')])
