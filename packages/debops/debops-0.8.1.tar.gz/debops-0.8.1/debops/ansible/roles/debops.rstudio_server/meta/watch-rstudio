# The tag v1.2.679 seems to be for something else than the Open Source version
# of RStudio Server which is relevant to the role. The uscan command wants to
# pick the higher version, so let's trick it into tracking v1.1.x series instead.

# Role: debops.rstudio_server
# Package: rstudio
# Version: 1.1.383
