d3fdgraph
---------

Plots an interactive force directed graph in a jupyter notebook, taking data from a dataframe of nodes and link weights.

The dataframe must contain two columns of nodes, and a third column of weights:
 1. from node
 2. to node
 3. link weight

To use (with caution), simply do::

    >>> import d3fdgraph
