Text mining of the biomedical literature has been successful in retrieving interactions between proteins, non-coding RNAs, and chemicals as well as in determining tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization. Simple co-occurrence-based scoring schemes can uncover such associations by finding entity pairs that are frequently mentioned together but ignore the textual context of each co-occurrence.

CoCoScore implements an improved context-aware co-occurrence scoring scheme that uses textual context to assess whether an association is described in a given sentence or not. CoCoScore achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches that rely on constant sentence scores, based on datasets of disease-gene, tissue-gene, and protein-protein associations.
In our research, we use `distant supervision <https://github.com/JungeAlexander/cocoscore/blob/master/doc/example/example.md#appendix-distant-supervision>`_ to create an automatic, but noisy, labelling of a large dataset of sentences co-mentioning two entities of interest.

Installation
============

To install CoCoScore via bioconda (for Linux and Mac OS):


::

    conda install -c bioconda cocoscore


To install CoCoScore via pip:


::

    pip install cocoscore


CoCoScore depends on `fastText <https://fasttext.cc/>`_ which needs to be installed separately if CoCoScore was installed via pip.
The installation via bioconda automatically installs fastText, too.

If you installed you installed CoCoScore via pip, please build v0.1.0 of fastText as described `here <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/#building-fasttext-using-make-preferred>`_ and make sure the ``fasttext`` binary is discoverable via your ``$PATH`` environment variable.

fastText v0.1.0 is also available via `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fasttext>`_:


::

   conda install -c conda-forge fasttext=0.1.0


**CoCoScore docker container:**


Bioconda automatically builds a Docker container for CoCoScore. 
See the `package documentation <https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/cocoscore/README.html>`_ for more information.


Quick start
===========

1. Follow the installation instructions above.
2. Download the ``demo.ftz`` file (see next section) needed to run through the example.
3. Run through the `example <https://github.com/JungeAlexander/cocoscore/blob/master/doc/example/example.md>`_ to learn how to apply CoCoScore to your own data.


Example usage
==============

Before running the examples, please download the following file and save it to ``doc/example/``:

- `Example pre-trained fastText model <http://download.jensenlab.org/BLAH4/demo.ftz>`_

The files are downloaded and placed in the correct directories by executing:

::

    wget -P doc/example/ http://download.jensenlab.org/BLAH4/demo.ftz


Preprint manuscript
====================

A preprint manuscript describing CoCoScore and its performance on eight datasets, compared to a baseline co-occurrence scoring model, is available `via bioRxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/16/444398>`_.

Supplementary data described in the manuscript can be downloaded `via figshare <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7198280.v1>`_.


Contributors
=============

CoCoScore is being developed by Alexander Junge and Lars Juhl Jensen at the
Disease Systems Biology Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research,
Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

Development
===========

To run the all tests run::

    tox

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:

.. list-table::
