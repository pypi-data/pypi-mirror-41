Description: TSSV: Targeted characterisation of short structural variation
        =============================================================
        
        TSSV is a program that does targeted characterisation of short structural
        variation. It can be used for STR analysis, or any other type of targeted
        analysis. It characterises any variation between a set of user-defined markers.
        
        TSSV is platform-independent. It has been tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
