BzrTools
========

Overview
--------

BzrTools is a collection of useful enhancements to Breezy.
For installation instructions, see the BzrTools home page:
http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/BzrTools.
Here is a sample of the frequently used commands it provides.


shell
-----

``brz shell`` starts up a command interpreter than understands
Breezy commands natively. This has several advantages:

 * There's no need to type ``brz`` at the front of every command.

 * Intelligent auto-completion is provided.

 * Commands run slightly faster as there's no need to load Breezy's
   libraries each time.


cdiff
-----

``brz cdiff`` provides a colored version of ``brz diff`` output.
On GNU/Linux, UNIX and OS X, this is often used like this::

  brz cdiff | less -R
