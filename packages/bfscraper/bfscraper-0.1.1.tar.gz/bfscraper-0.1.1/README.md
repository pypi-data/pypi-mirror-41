# bfscraper

---

The package scrapes Betfair price data (BSP, WAP etc) for Australian horse racing markets.

---

You can use the package in the following way:

```python
from bfscraper import bfscraper

df = bfscraper.scrape("2018-01-01", "2018-12-31")

print(df)
```

---

The above code would scrape the relevant data from January 1, 2018 till December 31, 2018.

The data would be returned in a Pandas dataframe format which can then be exported to a CSV or other file formats.

There may be scope in the future to expand this package to other jurisdictions and racing codes.
