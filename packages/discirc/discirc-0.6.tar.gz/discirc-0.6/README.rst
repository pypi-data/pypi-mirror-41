Launch
******

You first need to configure **DiscIRC** thanks to a config file. By default **DiscIRC** tries to load a `~/.discirc` file, if not present you need to give it to the app with the `-- config` option.

To create a valid config file please see the `example <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j0ack/discirc/master/config-example.json>`_.

Then simply run **DiscIRC** thanks to the available command::

  $ discirc

Private messages
****************

**DiscIRC** handles private messages. You need to prefix your message with a `@User` when sent from **Discord** and with `User:` from IRC.
