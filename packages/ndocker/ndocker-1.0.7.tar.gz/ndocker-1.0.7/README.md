## Intoduction: docker network configration for UTE

Origin:

Docker container network configration is a repetitive job in our daily work.
We run many contaniers on a server, and configure several interfaces for each container. When container restarted, all networks are lost.

so we need a tool to get things done, that'all.

## Get started

For centos

```
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install python-pip
pip install ndocker
```
