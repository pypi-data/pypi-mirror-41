A simple Python API to read data from howlongtobeat.com.

It is inspired by [ckatzorke - howlongtobeat](https://github.com/ckatzorke/howlongtobeat) JS API.

## Usage

## Installation

### Installing the package downloading the last release

```python
pip install howlongtobeatpy
```

### Installing the package from the source code

Download the repo, enter the folder with 'setup.py' and run the command

```python
pip install .
```

## Usage in code

### Start including it in your file

```python
from howlongtobeatpy import HowLongToBeat
```

### Now call search()

The API main functions are:

```python
results = HowLongToBeat().search("Awesome Game")
```

or, if you prefer using async:

```python
results = await HowLongToBeat().async_search("Awesome Game")
```

The return of that function is a **list** of possible games, or **None** in case you passed an invalid "game name" as parameter or if there was an error in the request.

If the list **is not None** you should choose the best entry checking the Similarity value with the original name, example:

```python
results_list = await HowLongToBeat().async_search("Awesome Game")
if results_list is not None and len(results_list) > 0:
    max_sim = -1
    best_element = None
    for element in results_list:
        if element.similarity > max_sim:
            max_sim = element.similarity
            best_element = element
```

At the end of the for cycle "best_element" will contain the best game found in the research.

### Reading an entry

An entry is made of few values, you can check them [in the Entry class file](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/HowLongToBeat-PythonAPI/blob/master/howlongtobeatpy/howlongtobeatpy/HowLongToBeatEntry.py)

## Found a bug?

Please report it as soon as you can creating an [issue](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/HowLongToBeat-PythonAPI/issues/new), the code may not be perfect.
