# DeepVOG

DeepVOG is a framework for pupil segmentation and gaze estimation based on a fully convolutional neural network. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run DeepVOG, you need to have a Python distribution (we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)) and the following Python packages:

```
scikit-image
Tensorflow
etc.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get DeepVOG running.
