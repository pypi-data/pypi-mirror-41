The following changes have been made to the original source:
    * Removed configuration of logging and the LOGGER variable.
        All log messages are still emitted.
    * Isolated the ExamplePublisher class. Removed class instantiation
        and application logic.
    * Renamed the class from ExamplePublisher to AsyncPublisher.
    * Modified __init__() and connect() methods to allow user to
        pass either a URL or ConnectionParameters instance.
