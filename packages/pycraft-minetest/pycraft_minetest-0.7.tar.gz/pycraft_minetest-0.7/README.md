Repository for the Pypi "pycraft_minetest" Python Package.

Modified, simplified and improved libraries to code in python via Minetest.

Based on the terrific idea and the original code of David Whale and Martin O'Hanlon (www.stuffaboutcode.com).

# Getting Started
## Install Python
* Go to https://www.python.org
* Choose Python 2.7

## Install Pycraft library
* Open a terminal
* Run command (as superuser on LINUX or MAC, so for example preceeded by "sudo"): pip install pycraft_minetest

### Scratch extension
(Work in progress...)
If you're planning to use the Pycraft library also in Scratch:
* <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprintingkiwi/pycraft_mod/master/pycraft.s2e" download>Click here to download the pycraft.s2e extension file</a>
* Open Scratch Offline Editor (here's how to install it: https://scratch.mit.edu/download)
* Pressing SHIFT + Left Click on "File" menu, select "Import experimental HTTP extension" and load the downloaded "pycraft.s2e" file.

## Install Minetest and the Pycraft mod
Follow these instructions: https://github.com/sprintingkiwi/pycraft_mod/blob/master/README.md

## Create your Python script and run it
### Setup an editor for Python
You can use your favourite Python IDE... anyway we suggest Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). If you install Pycharm, we also suggest to import these settings:
* [WINDOWS or LINUX](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9leATA2g5JjT3V4RVNLNWpvNms)
* [MAC](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9leATA2g5JjQTBzSmdETmxCX1k)

So after the first execution, click on FILE -> Import settings and then select the downloaded settings file.

### RECIPES
Now that the Pycraft environment is setted up you are ready to explore and play with Python in Minecraft.
