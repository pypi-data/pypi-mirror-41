        Notes
        -----
        
        Development is still on-going --- expect the API and the internal classes to change rapidly.
        
        The project's structure was originally generated by `cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_ via `ionelmc's template <https://github.com/ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary>`_.
