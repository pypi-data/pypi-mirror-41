Description: 
        Asynchronous task queueing based on the Twisted framework, with task
        prioritization and a powerful worker interface. Worker implementations
        are included for running tasks asynchronously in the main thread, in
        separate threads, in separate Python interpreters (multiprocessing),
        and even on separate devices using Twisted's Asynchronouse Message
        Protocol.
        
        Includes deferred iteration capability: Calling a task that returns an
        iterator can return a Deferator_ instead, which does the iteration in
        a Twisted-friendly fashion, even over a network connection. You can
        also supply an object conforming to Twisted's IConsumer interface and
        iterations will be fed to it as they become available.
        
        Includes an example package mcMandelbrot_ that generates Mandelbrot
        set images, row by row, demonstrating the power of asynchronous
        multi-core processing. An instance of ProcessQueue_ dispatches the
        computations for each row of pixels to workers running on separate
        Python processes. The color-mapped RGB results are collected as they
        come back and intelligently buffered for iterating in a proper
        sequence to a third-party PNG library that wouldn't ordinarily play
        nice with Twisted.
        
        You can try things out after installation by running `mcmandelbrot`
        (with a few options and arguments) from the console. The output of the
        script is a PNG file, which you can view by piping to the free Feh
        image viewer: Just add `|feh -` at the end of the command line.
        
        There was some effort toward Python 3 compatiblity a while ago, but
        it's still not yet supported.
