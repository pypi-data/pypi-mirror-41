    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : hvs448 Project Overview
========================================================================
1/21/2019 HVS448 Python support V 2.0 dev
uProcess C++, C#, .NET support V 2.0

The file hvs448.pyd contains Python (3.6, i86, 32-bit) support for controlling all models of the LabSmith HVS448.

The files HVS448*.dll provide C++ and C-language support for controlling LabSmith uDevices. The versions having a post-pended '_x64'  are 64-bit builds. The rest are 32-bit builds. Both unicode versions (with a postpended 'u') and ASCII versions are included. Versions with a post-pended 'd' are compiled with multi-threaded debugging (Visual Studio 2017). The folder includes contains C++ header files and descriptions of the use of the functions and data structures in the SDK. 

These libraries are provided as-is with no guarantee of suitability for an application, but it is LabSmith's intent to provide error-free, resource efficient, and easy-to-use tools for developers. Please contact LabSmith support: support@labsmith.com if there are any issues with the use of these libraries or if alternative build options or functionality is needed.
