UCSC Single Cell Browser
========================

The UCSC Cell Browser is a viewer for single cell data. You can click on and
hover over cells to get meta information, search for genes to color on and
click clusters to show cluster-specific marker genes. 

To look at a list of selected single cell datasets, see http://cells.ucsc.edu

To setup your own cell browser, from Cellranger, Seurat, Scanpy or text files 
(tsv/csv), or just a single cell expression matrix, read the documentation
at http://cellbrowser.rtfd.io

If you want us to add a single cell dataset to the website http://cells.ucsc.edu, 
please contact us at cells@ucsc.edu. We are happy to add any dataset.

This is a viewer for a static, precomputed layout. If you're looking for an interative layout, where you can 
move the cells around and run algorithsm interactively, try Chan-Zuckerberg's own cellxgene or Spring.

This is early research software. You are likely to find bugs. Please open a Github
ticket or email us at cells@ucsc.edu, we can usually fix them quickly.
