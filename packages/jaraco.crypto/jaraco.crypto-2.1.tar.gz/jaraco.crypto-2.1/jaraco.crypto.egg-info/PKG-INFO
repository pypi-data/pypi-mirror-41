        Many of the ideas and much of the code has been adapted from or inspired by
        several other projects, including:
        
        - The code repository was originally a fork of the `ctypescrypto project
          <http://code.google.com/p/ctypescrypto/>`_. The code history includes the
          full history of the ancestral project.
        - The blowfish code was adapted from a module contributed to the community
          by Michael Gilfix.
