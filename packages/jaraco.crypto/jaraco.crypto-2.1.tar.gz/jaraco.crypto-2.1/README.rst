Many of the ideas and much of the code has been adapted from or inspired by
several other projects, including:

- The code repository was originally a fork of the `ctypescrypto project
  <http://code.google.com/p/ctypescrypto/>`_. The code history includes the
  full history of the ancestral project.
- The blowfish code was adapted from a module contributed to the community
  by Michael Gilfix.
