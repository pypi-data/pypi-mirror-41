Description: PennyLane Forest Plugin
        #######################
        
        
        Contains the PennyLane Forest plugin. This plugin allows three Rigetti devices to work with PennyLane - the wavefunction simulator, the Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM), and Quantum Processing Units (QPUs).
        
        `pyQuil <https://pyquil.readthedocs.io>`_ is a Python library for quantum programming using the quantum instruction language (Quil) - resulting quantum programs can be executed using the `Rigetti Forest SDK <https://www.rigetti.com/forest>`_ and the `Rigetti QCS <https://www.rigetti.com/qcs>`_.
        
        `PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a machine learning library for optimization and automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Provides three devices to be used with PennyLane: ``forest.wavefunction``, ``forest.qvm``, and ``forest.qpu``. These provide access to the Forest wavefunction simulator, quantum virtual machine (QVM), and quantum processing unit (QPU) respectively.
        
        * All provided devices support all core qubit PennyLane operations.
        
        * In addition, ``forest.wavefunction`` supports all core qubit PennyLane expectation values. ``forest.qvm`` and ``forest.qpu`` only support ``PauliZ`` expectation values.
        
        * Provides custom PennyLane operations to cover additional pyQuil operations: ``T``, ``S``, ``ISWAP``, ``CCNOT``, ``PSWAP``, and many more. Every custom operation supports analytic differentiation.
        
        * Combine Forest and the Rigetti Cloud Services with PennyLane's automatic differentiation and optimization.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        PennyLane-Forest requires both PennyLane and pyQuil. It can be installed via ``pip``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ python -m pip install pennylane-forest
        
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        Once the PennyLane-Forest plugin is installed, the three provided pyQuil devices can be accessed straight away in PennyLane.
        
        You can instantiate these devices for PennyLane as follows:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import pennylane as qml
            dev_simulator = qml.device('forest.wavefunction', wires=2)
            dev_qvm = qml.device('forest.qvm', device='2q-qvm', wires=2, shots=1000)
            dev_qpu = qml.device('forest.qpu', device='Aspen-0-12Q-A', shots=1000)
        
        These devices can then be used just like other devices for the definition and evaluation of QNodes within PennyLane. For more details, see the `plugin usage guide <https://pennylane-forest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ and refer to the PennyLane documentation.
