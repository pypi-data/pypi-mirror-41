# robotframework-datadriver

 DataDriver is a Data-Driven Testing library for Robot Framework.  
 This document explains how to use the DataDriver library listener. For information about installation, support, and more, please visit the [project pages](https://github.com/Snooz82/robotframework-datadriver). For more information about Robot Framework, see http://robotframework.org.  
 
 DataDriver is used/imported as Library but does not provide keywords which can be used in a test. DataDriver uses the Listener Interface Version 3 to manipulate the test cases and creates new test cases based on a CSV-File that contains the data f√ºr Data-Driven Testing.  

## Installation

It is not uploaded to PyPi i  the moment.
You may download the sources and install the package locally.

`pip install <path to base folder>`

## What DataDriver does

DataDriver is an alternative approach to create Data-Driven Tests with Robot Framework. DataDriver creates multiple test cases based on a test template and data contend of a CSV file. All created tests share the same test sequence (keywords) and differs in the test data. Because these tests are created on runtime only the template has to be specified within the robot test specification and the used data are specified in an external CSV file.  
  

## How DataDriver works

 When the DataDriver is used in a test suite it will be activated before the test suite starts. It uses the Listener Interface Version 3 of Robot Framework to read and modify the test specification objects. After activation it searches for the `Test Template` -Keyword to analyse the `[Arguments]` is has. As second step it loads the data from the specified CSV file. Based on the `Test Template` -Keyword, DataDriver creates as much test cases as lines are in the CSV file. As values for the arguments of the `Test Template` -Keyword it reads values from the column of the CSV file with the matching name of the `[Arguments]`. For each line of the CSV data table one test case will be created. It is also possible to specify test case names, tags and documentation for each test case in the specific test suite related CSV file.  
 

## Usage

 Data Driver is a "Listener" but should not be set as a global listener as command line option of robot. Because Data Driver is a listener and a library at the same time it sets itself as a listener when this library is imported in a test suite.  

### Limitation

#### Eclipse plug-in RED
There are known issues if the Eclipse plug-in RED is used. Because the debugging Listener of this tool pre calculates the number of test cases before the creation of test cases by the Data Driver. This leads to the situation that the RED listener throws exceptions because it is called for each test step but the RED GUI already stopped debugging, so that the listener cannot send Information to the GUI. This does not influence the execution in any way but produces a lot of unwanted exceptions in the Log.  

#### Variable types 
In this early Version of Data Driver only acalar variables are supported. Lists and dictionaries may be added in the next releases.  

#### No RPA support 
In this early Version the design is made for test cases. RPA support may be added later if requested.  

### How to activate the Data Driver
To activate the DataDriver for a test suite (one specific *.robot file) just import it as library.
You may also specify some options, if the default parameters do not fit your needs.  

**Example**:

    *** Settings *** 
    Library          DataDriver
    Test Template    Invalid Logins 

  
## Structure of test suite
### Requirements
In the Moment there are some requirements how a test suite must be structured, so that the DataDriver can get all information it needs.  
 - only the first test case will be used as template. All other test cases will be deleted. 
 - Test cases has to be defined with a `Test Template`. Reason for this is, that the DataDriver needs to know the names of the test case arguments. Test cases do not have named arguments. Keywords do. 
 - The keyword which is used as `Test Template` must be defined within the test suite (in the same \*.robot file). If the keyword which is used as `Test Template` is defined in a `Resource` the DataDriver has no access to its arguments names.  

### Example Test Suite

    ***Settings*** 
    Library    	      DataDriver 
    Resource          login_resources.robot 
    Suite Setup       Open my Browser 
    Suite Teardown    Close Browsers 
    Test Setup        Open Login Page 
    Test Template     Invalid Login 
    
    *** Test Case *** 
    Login with user ${username} and password ${password}    Default    UserData 
    
    ***** *Keywords* ***** 
    Invalid login 
        [Arguments]    ${username}    ${password}
        Input username    ${username}
        Input pwd    ${password}
        click login button 
        Error page should be visible  

 In this example the DataDriver is activate by using it as Library. It is used with default settings.  
 As `Test Template` the keyword `Invalid Login` is used. This keyword has two arguments. Argument names are `${username}` and `${password}`. These names has to be in the CSV file as column header. The test case has two variable names included in its name, which does not have any functionality in Robot Framework. However the Data Driver will use the test case name as a template name and replaces the variables with the specific value of the single generated test case.  
 This template test will only be used as a template. The specified data `Default` and `UserData` would only be used, if no CSV file has been found.  
 
## Structure of data file
### min. required columns
 
- `*** Test Cases ***` column has to be the first one. 
- *Argument columns:* For each argument of the `Test Template` keyword one column must be existing in the CSV file as data source. The name of this column must match the variable name and syntax.  

### optional columns
- *[Tags]* column may be used to add specific to a test case. Tags may be comma separated. 
- *[Documentation]* column may be used to add specific test case documentation.  

### Example CSV file


|*** Test Cases ***|${username}|${password}|[Tags]|[Documentation]|
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Right user empty pass      | demo            | ${EMPTY}        | 1          | This is a test case documentation of the first one.         |
| Right user wrong pass      | demo            | FooBar          | 2          |                                                             |
| empty user mode pass       | ${EMPTY}        | mode            | 1,2,3,4    | This test case has the Tags 1,2,3 and 4 assigned.           |
|                            | ${EMPTY}        | ${EMPTY}        |            | This test case has a generated name based on template name. |
|                            | ${EMPTY}        | FooBar          |            | This test case has a generated name based on template name. |
|                            | FooBar          | mode            |            | This test case has a generated name based on template name. |
|                            | FooBar          | ${EMPTY}        |            | This test case has a generated name based on template name. |
|                            | FooBar          | FooBar          |            | This test case has a generated name based on template name. | 

 In this CSV file eight test cases are defined. Each line specifies one test case. The first two test cases has specific names. The other six test cases will generate names based on template test cases name with the replacement of variables in this name. The order of columns is irrelevant except the first column, `*** Test Cases ***`  
 
## Encoding and CSV Dialect
CSV is far away from well designed and has absolutely no "common" format. Therefore it is possible to define your own dialect or use predefined. Default is Excel-EU which is a semicolon separated file.  
 These Settings are changeable as options of the Data Driver Library.  
 
#### file=
- None(default): Data Driver will search in the test suites folder if a *.csv file with the same name than the testsuite.robot exists 
- absolute Path: If not None, Data Driver tries to find the given CSV file as absolute path. 
- relative Path: If option does not point to a CSV file as absolute path, Data Driver tries to find a csv file relative to the folder where the test suite is located.  

#### encoding=
may set the encoding of the CSV file. 
i.e. `cp1252, ascii, iso-8859-1, latin-1, utf_8, utf_16, utf_16_be, utf_16_le`, etc... 
https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings  

#### dialect=
You may change the CSV Dialect here. If the Dialect is set to 'UserDefined' the following options are used. Otherwise they are ignored.  
 supported Dialects are:  
 

    "excel"
        delimiter = ','
        quotechar = '"'
        doublequote = True
        skipinitialspace = False
        lineterminator = '\r\n'
        quoting = QUOTE_MINIMAL
    
    "excel-tab"
        delimiter = '\t'
    
    "unix"
        delimiter = ','
        quotechar = '"'
        doublequote = True
        skipinitialspace = False
        lineterminator = '\n'
        quoting = QUOTE_ALL

#### Defaults:
        file=None,
        encoding='cp1252',
        dialect='Excel-EU',
        delimiter=';',
        quotechar='"',
        escapechar='\',
        doublequote=True,
        skipinitialspace=False,
        lineterminator='\r\n'
