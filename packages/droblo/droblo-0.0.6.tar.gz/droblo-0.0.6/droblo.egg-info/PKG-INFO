Description: # Droblo
        
        A multi-hosts oriented, PostgreSQL backed, filesystem duplication detection system.
        
        **Identify duplicated files on multiple hosts on the network, and/or ensure all files being watched are saved to 
        multiple locations.**
        
        
        Droblo uses a Postgresql database for storing files fingerprint of multiple hosts under watch.
        
        - droblod is the daemon watching your hosts filesystem events, storing corresponding files fingerprints centrally.
        - droblo_reports generates reports accordingly.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        * python 3.5 or above and the modules listed in pip_requirements.txt on machines where you intend to watch files from.
        
        * a server running any PostgreSQL version still being maintained. 
        
        ### Installation
        
        Please refer to [Droblo database setup](droblo/docs/droblo_database_setup.md) for creating the database.
        
        Please refer to [Hosts installation](droblo/docs/hosts_installation.md) for installation of Droblo on the watched hosts.
