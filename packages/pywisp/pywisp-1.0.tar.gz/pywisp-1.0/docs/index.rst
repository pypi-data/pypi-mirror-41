Welcome to PyWisp's documentation!
==================================

PyWisp stands for *Weird visualisation of test bench prototypes*.

PyWisp is targeted at students and researchers working in control engineering. It helps
to implement and run a communication and visualization for a test bench. Based on PyMoskito GUI
it is easy to use, if you run your simulations in it. It uses the same modular structure
to design a control flow for the test bench.
