Step1 - Create a python module which you want to expose as  distribution (*.py)
Step2 - use setuptools to prepare a distribution 
    from setuptools import setup
step3- create a folder in which you want your code to be created as distribution
step4- move your python file to the new folder created in step3
step5 - create a setup.py file in the new folder created in step3
step6 - build a distribution file 

    python3 setup.py sdist
  sdist             create a source distribution (tarball, zip file, etc.)

step7 - install your distribution into your local copy of python

    python3 setup.py install
  install           install everything from build directory

******** YOUR DISTRIBUTION IS READY **************

NOW THAT YOUR MODULE IS BUILT, PACKAGED AS A DISTRIBUTION AND INSTALLED --> IT IS READY TO BE IMPORTED
AND USED
