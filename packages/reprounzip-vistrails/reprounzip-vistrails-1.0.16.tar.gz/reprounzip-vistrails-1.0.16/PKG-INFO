Description: ReproZip
        ========
        
        `ReproZip <https://www.reprozip.org/>`__ is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a package that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given command on the author's computational environment (packing step).  A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).
