libgs.monitoring
=================

:date:   Mon Sep 18 09:22:40 2017
:author: Kjetil Wormnes

Monitoring is a stand-alone module that allows monitoring of telemetry points while
attempting to have a minimal impact on the execution of the rest of the code.

It implements a simple pythonic syntax for the creation of monitoring points. To use;

1. Create a monitor

>>> from libgs.monitoring import Monitor
>>> mon = Monitor()

2. Define a function that returns the monitored value, 
and decorate it with mon.monitor(). 

For example, to monitor the current time:

>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> @mon.monitor()
>>> def current_time():
>>>    return datetime.utcnow()

3. Start the monitor

>>> mon.start()

And that's it. The current time is now monitored at the default update interval 
under a monitor point called "current_time". 
You can view the state of the monitor by printing it::

    >>> print(mon)
    Monitor ()  -- running
    Name                          Value               Alert     Last polled   
    ----------------------------- ------------------- --------- ---------------
    .current_time                 2018-06-21 00:39:07           0.7


More complicated monitoring functions can easily be created by specifying the point
value in the decorator. See :meth:`Monitor.monitor` for syntax. You can also change
the update interval etc...

The constructor also takes some arguments to customise its default behaviour. See :class:`Monitor`.

You are able to add callbacks whenever a monitored value is updated. This is useful
if you are displaying the data on a dashboard or updating a database. See :meth:`Monitor.add_callback`.

Finally, you can set alert levels by returning an Alert object rather than a value from
your monitoring function. This module defines :class:`GreenAlert`, :class:`OrangeAlert`, 
:class:`RedAlert`, and :class:`CriticalAlert`. You are welcome to customise or make others 
by deriving a new subclass from :class:`Alert`.

The following example monitoring function gets the cpu usage every 2 seconds, and
marks the alert as Red if it is above 50%:

>>> @mon.monitor(dt = 2)
>>> def cpu_usage():
>>>     usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)
>>>     if usage > 50:
>>>         return RedAlert(usage)
>>>     else:
>>>         return GreenAlert(usage)

class Monitor(object):
    """
    Class to provide functionality for monitoring.

    The monitor class works by spawning a threadpool in which it will call a number
    of user-defined monitoring functions. Every tick, it will check the list
    of monitoring functions to find the ones that are due and then invoke them in the
    threadpool. It then *immediately proceeds to the next tick*.

    In other words, monitoring functions are free to do whatever they want, including
    to block for a while since while it is running the Monitor class will just proceed
    with executing other monitoring functions (up to the limit of the workers in the threadpool).

    Monitoring functions are added to the class instance preferably using the 
    :meth:`monitor` decorator. 
    
    It is possible to add callbacks to monitor points that are invoked every time the value
    is updated.

    It is also possible to add a single tick callback when creating the Monitor object. Take
    care when doing this as it is invoked at the end of every tick, and the next tick will not
    execute before it completes. Therefore care should be taken to ensure tick callbacks return very
    fast.

    This restriction does not apply to monitor callbacks as they are executed in the Threadpool with
    the call to the monitor function and will therefore not hold up the Monitor overall.

               any call to the generators next() function will return immeditately and not hold up execution. If

            2. Add the function to the Monitor class polling schedule.

        The decorator can create multiple monitor points from a single callable (that returns a tuple) by

            of once every 10 seconds, grouped under the heading Test:
