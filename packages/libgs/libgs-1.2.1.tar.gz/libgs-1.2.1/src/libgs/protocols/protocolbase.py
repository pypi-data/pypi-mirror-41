Base class for protocols.

Protocols tend to be spacecraft specific and the ground-component of it should
be considered part of the spacecraft development. For protocols to be used by libgs
they must derive from ProtocolBase and implement its interface. See :class:`ProtocolBase`
for details.

class ProtocolBase(object):
    """
    Base class for protocols. Defines the primary interface that is used
    by the scheduler. Any protocol used by the library must implement
    the following methods:

    * :meth:`send_bytes`: Send a sequence of bytes to the satellite
    * :meth:`do_action`: Ask the protocol to do something. The do_action should take different  
      actions, depending on the arguments, but there are no further requirements on what those arguments 
      should be.
    * :meth:`set_handler`: Set callback for when data is received back from satellite, this is invoked
      by the ground-station class upon creation. The groundstation will expect the callback function to be called
      every time data is received from the satellite. It is the responsibility of the Protocol to ensure that
      happens.

    The following class attribute shall also be overloaded:

    * :attr:`name` : The name of the protocol

    Additionally a protocol *may* implement the following methods:

    * :meth:`init_rx` : This method will be called by the scheduler before starting a listening pass. It should contain
      any initialisation routines required.
    * :meth:`init_rxtx` : This method will be called by the scheduler before starting a transmitting pass. It should contain
      any initialisation routines required (power on amplifiers etc...)
    * :meth:`terminate` : This method will be called by the scheduler as soon as a pass has finished. It should contain
      any clean-up routines required (power off amplifiers etc...), and most importantly ensure that
      any threads or loops initiated by the Protocolclass are immediately terminated in a clean and
      controlled manner.


    When the scheduler starts a pass it will also set an attribute on the protocol class called sch_metadata. This
    attribute contains all the metadata stored in the currently scheduled :class:`~libgs_ops.scheduling.CommsPass`, and is available to the Protocol
    class to refer to as needed.

    .. warning:: Warning 1

        This class should avoid blocking functions at all cost, and need to respond to the global abort_all event to allow
        libgs to shut down cleanly. A method is provided in libgs.utils called wait_loop that can be used as a
        replacement for time.sleep and/or waiting for events to occur. wait_loop will automatically handle the global
        abort_all event.

    .. warning:: Warning 2

        It is imperative that the terminate() method immediately stops any and all running processes or threads
        spawned by the Protocol class.

        the callback function whenever it receives any data from the spacecraft. The groundstation will then take appropriate
        action to log the data in the mysql database.

        The callback function takes a single argument msg, which has to comply with the following requirements:

            - It shall be a string
            - It shall either be a series of hexadecimal values corresponding to the received bytes (e.g. 'AB-CD-00-01')
