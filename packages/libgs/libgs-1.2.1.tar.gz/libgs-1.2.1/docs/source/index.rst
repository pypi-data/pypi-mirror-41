Welcome to libgs's documentation!
=================================

.. warning::

   If you are reading this on readthedocs, the documentation is most likely broken.
   So until I succeed in getting it to play nice with RTD (i.e. until further notice), it will be hosted
   on github pages and you can access it at the following address:
