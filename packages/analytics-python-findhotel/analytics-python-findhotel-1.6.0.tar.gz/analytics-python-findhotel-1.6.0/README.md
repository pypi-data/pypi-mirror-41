# analytics-python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FindHotel/analytics-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FindHotel/analytics-python)

analytics-python is a python client is a slightly modified version of [Segment's Python client library][segmentsdk]. This fork of Segment's `analytics-python` is fully compliant with the original Segment's SDK API, but it allows delivering the recorded events to a custom HTTP endpoint.

[segmentsdk]: https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-python

## Usage

The documentation for Segment's Python SDK that this repository is based on
is available at [https://segment.com/libraries/python](https://segment.com/libraries/python).
Check Segment's docs to get familiar with the API.

You can package directly, in this case default `http` transport will be used:

```python
import analytics

# This key will be passed in the `x-api-key` header of every request
analytics.write_key='AWS_API_GATEWAY_KEY'

# The custom endpoint to where the events will be delivered to
analytics.endpoint='https://segment.fih.io/v1/[endpoint-key]'

analytics.track('kljsdgs99', 'SignedUp', {'plan': 'Enterprise'})
analytics.flush()
```

Use client with custom error handling function:

```python

import analytics

ANALYTICS_WRITE_KEY='AWS_API_GATEWAY_KEY'
ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT='https://segment.fih.io/v1/[endpoint-key]'

def log_error(e, batch):
  print("exception: {}, batch: {}".format(e, batch), flush=True)

client = analytics.Client(
  endpoint=ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT,
  write_key=ANALYTICS_WRITE_KEY,
  debug=analytics.debug,
  on_error=log_error,
  send=analytics.send,
  max_queue_size=analytics.max_queue_size,
  upload_size=analytics.upload_size
)

client.track(...)
client.flush()
```

### Using S3 transport

When using `s3` transport SDK will upload data directly to AWS S3 bypassing http interface.

```python

MB = 1024*1024

c = Client(
     write_key="write-key",
     endpoint="https://segment.fih.io/v1/[endpoint-key]",
     upload_size=1*MB,
     transport='s3',
     max_queue_size=1000000,
)

for i in range(30000):
     c.track(
          user_id='pavel',
          event='UUIDGenerated',
          properties=dict(id=str(uuid.uuid4()), counter=i)
     )
     if i % 10000 == 0:
          c.flush()

c.flush()
assert False
```
