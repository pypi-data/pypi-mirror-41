        Iterator over the participants belonging to the specified chat.

        Args:
            entity (`entity`):
                The entity from which to retrieve the participants list.

            limit (`int`):
                Limits amount of participants fetched.

            search (`str`, optional):
                Look for participants with this string in name/username.

                If ``aggressive is True``, the symbols from this string will
                be used.

            filter (:tl:`ChannelParticipantsFilter`, optional):
                The filter to be used, if you want e.g. only admins
                Note that you might not have permissions for some filter.
                This has no effect for normal chats or users.

                .. note::

                    The filter :tl:`ChannelParticipantsBanned` will return
                    *restricted* users. If you want *banned* users you should
                    use :tl:`ChannelParticipantsKicked` instead.

            aggressive (`bool`, optional):
                Aggressively looks for all participants in the chat.

                This is useful for channels since 20 July 2018,
                Telegram added a server-side limit where only the
                first 200 members can be retrieved. With this flag
                set, more than 200 will be often be retrieved.

                This has no effect if a ``filter`` is given.

            _total (`list`, optional):
                A single-item list to pass the total parameter by reference.

        Yields:
            The :tl:`User` objects returned by :tl:`GetParticipantsRequest`
            with an additional ``.participant`` attribute which is the
            matched :tl:`ChannelParticipant` type for channels/megagroups
            or :tl:`ChatParticipants` for normal chats.
