Description: Overview
        ========
        
        We've always wanted to edit the footer of Plone providing our
        customers' contact info.
        
        We've **always** customized both portal_footer.pt and
        portal_colophon.pt in our Plone 2.5.x sites, but now we can hide them
        easily hiding plone.footer and plone.colophon viewlets through
        @@manage-viewlets or setting a viewlets.xml in an extension profile,
        thanks to new viewlet infrastructure in Plone3.
        
        This product adds a new viewlet called cs.editablefooter and it's
        added automatically to plone.portalfooter portlet manager
        
        It also creates a new control panel in which you can edit the content
        of the viewlet using a WYSIWYG editor.
        
        
        Upgrade
        ==========
        
        From version 2.0 on, the permission to edit the contents of the viewlet
        has been changed from "Manage portal" to a custom "cs.editablefooter: edit footer".
        
        By default this permission is assigned to Site Administrators and Managers.
        
        Go to the Add-on controlpanel and hit upgrade.
