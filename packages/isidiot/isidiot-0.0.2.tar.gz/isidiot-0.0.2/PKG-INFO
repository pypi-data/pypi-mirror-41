        ## Why is this needed?
        
        In Python, it's insanely hard to check that someone is an idiot. This library makes your life much easier because it's extremely lightweight and doesn't affect your application's performance so much!
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```py
        from isidiot import is_idiot
        ```
        
        ### true
        
        ```py
        is_idiot("me");                    # true
        is_idiot("you");                   # true
        is_idiot("node.js developers");    # true
        is_idiot('Every JS "programmer"'); # true
        ```
