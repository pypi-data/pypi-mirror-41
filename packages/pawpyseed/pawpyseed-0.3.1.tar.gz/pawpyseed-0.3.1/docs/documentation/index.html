<p><b>WARNING: PAWpySeed is still in early development. Documentation is incomplete, and some features are not yet thoroughly tested. High-priority issues for the next couple months include: 1) documentation page containing the mathematical formalism, 2) examples and tutorials, 3) standardized unit tests. The evaluation of overlap operators is tested, but a standard test suite is not yet published, and some features still require more thorough testing.</b></p>
<p>PAWpySeed is a parallelized Python and C tool for reading and analyzing the optimized band structure and wave functions of VASP DFT calculations. The code is written for the PAW formalism developed by P.E. Blochl and implemented in VASP.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p><b>Note</b>: Before installing with pip or the setup script, please read about the dependencies and set up your environment correctly!</p>
<p>You can install PAWpySeed with <code>pip</code>.</p>

<p>This has been tested on Scientific Linux 7 and Linux Mint 18, but should work for systems that have the appropriate packages and environment variables defined as described below. Note that the setup script compiles and installs some C code as a shared object to be used by <code>ctypes</code> and places it in the package directory under <code>pawpyseed/core/</code>.</p>
<p>Installation can also be performed by cloning this repository and running the <code>setup.py</code> script in the root directory of the repository.</p>

<h3>PAW</h3>
<p>The projector augmented wave (PAW) method is a technique used in plane wave density functional theory to simplify the description of the wavefunctions near the nuclei of a system. The strong Coulombic forces near an atomic nucleus creates quickly oscillating wavefunctions that are not well described by plane waves without prohibitively large basis sets, so a "pseudopotential" is introduced near the atomic nuclei which results in smooth "pseudowavefunctions" well described by plane waves. The full wavefunctions can be recovered by a linear transform of the pseudowavefunctions. The PAW method requires three sets of functions: projector functions, onto which pseudowavefunctions are projected to probe their character; full partial waves, which describe atomic valence states derived from the true potential; and pseudo partial waves, which are derived from the full partial waves and pseudopotential.</p>
<h3>Files</h3>
<p>The projector functions and partial waves are unique to each element and stored in the POTCAR file used in a VASP calculation. The pseudowavefunction is the part of the wavefunction optimized during a DFT calculation and is stored in the WAVECAR output file in VASP. PAWpySeed parses both files to retrieve all parts of the full Kohn Sham wavefunctions.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>The main purpose of PAWpySeed is to evaluate overlap operators between Kohn-Sham wavefunctions from different structures, which is not done by standard plane-wave DFT codes. Such functionality can be useful for analyzing the composition of defect levels in solids, which is main application for which the code is currently focused.</p>

<p>The code in PAWpySeed is based on a several algorithms and codes, which are enumerated here.</p>

<li><b>VASP</b>: PAWpySeed is primarily built to read and process the output of VASP calculations. PAWpySeed reads PAW wavefunctions and calculate overlap operators using algorithms derived from VASP and other plane-wave codes, so the following citations are necessary. The last citation is specifically for the PAW method and potentials. See the VASP website at <a href="http://community.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/wiki/site/admin/vasp.html">http://community.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/wiki/site/admin/vasp.html</a> for information on citing specific functionals.<ul>

<li><b>NUMSBT</b>: NUMSBT is a code written by J. D. Talman, which implements an algorithm that calculates the spherical Bessel transform (SBT) in O(NlogN) time. PAWpySeed employs the high-k transform algorithm implemented in NUMSBT to calculate the overlap operators between overlapping augmentation spheres that have different positions or elements. It is also used to filter out high-frequency components from AE partial waves, which allows projections from pseudowavefunctions to AE partial waves to be performed in real space, which is a vital component of the code. NUMSBT is distributed under the Standard CPC License, and the algorithm is developed in the following paper:<ul>
