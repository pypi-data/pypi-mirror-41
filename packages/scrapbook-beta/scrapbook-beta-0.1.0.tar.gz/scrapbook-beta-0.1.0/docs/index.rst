Welcome to scrapbook
====================

**scrapbook** is a library for recording a notebook's data values and reading
these recorded data values at a later time

**scrapbook** provides a robust and flexible recording schema. This library is
planned to replace `papermill <https://papermill.readthedocs.io>`_'s existing
`record` functionality.

Use case
--------

Notebook users may wish to record data produced during a notebook execution.
This recorded data can then be read to be used at a later time or be passed to
another notebook as input.
