Description: # Random proxy middleware for [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/)
        
        ### Using [Scylla](https://github.com/imWildCat/scylla) to fetch valid proxies.
        
        <hr>
        
        NOTE: I am not a 'real' programmer, help always appreciated! But it works! ... for now.
        
        Processes Scrapy requests using a random proxies to avoid IP ban and
        improve crawling speed, this plugs in to the Scylla project which provides a local database of proxies.
        
        ## Install & run Scylla
        
        The Scylla project will need to be set-up separately!! The quickest way to do this is to use the docker container. The following command will download and run Scylla (provided you have docker installed of course).
        
            docker run -d -p 8899:8899 -p 8081:8081 --name scylla wildcat/scylla:latest
        
        ## Install scrapy-scylla-proxies
        
        The quick way:
        
            pip install scrapy-scylla-proxies
        
        Or checkout the source and run
        
            python setup.py install
        
        ## What to put in Scrapy's 'settings.py'
        
        This is stuff you are going to need to integrate this middleware with Scrapy.
        
        **SSP_ENABLED** - This **MUST** be set to True.
        
        **SSP_SCYLLA_URI** - The location of the Scylla API (Default: 'http://localhost:8899').
        
        **SSP_PROXY_TIMEOUT** - How often the proxy list is refreshed (Default: 60s).
        
        **SSP_HTTPS** - Whether to only use HTTPS proxies, You will need this set to True if you are scraping an HTTPS site (Default: True).
        
        **SSP_SPLASH_REQUEST_ENABLED** - Whether this middleware will need to set the proxy for a 'scrapy.Request' or a 'SplashRequest' (Default: False)
        
        ### Example 'settings.py'
        
        This is a sample taken directly from a working scraper of mine, I used it to scrape approximately 15000 items from a website without any 'bans'.
        
            # Configure maximum concurrent requests performed by Scrapy (default: 16)
            CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 32
        
            # Enable or disable downloader middlewares
            # See https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html
            DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
                # For retries
                'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.retry.RetryMiddleware': 290,
                # For random scylla proxies
                'scrapy_scylla_proxies.random_proxy.RandomProxyMiddleware': 300,
                # For http proxy ip rotation
                'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware': 750,
            }
        
            DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT = 180
            RETRY_TIMES = 10
            RETRY_HTTP_CODES = [500, 502, 503, 504, 408, 400, 429, 403, 404]
        
            # scrapy-scylla-proxies settings
            # Enabled
            SSP_ENABLED = True
            # Location of the scylla server
            SSP_SCYLLA_URI = 'http://localhost:8899'
            # Proxy timeout in seconds
            SSP_PROXY_TIMEOUT = 60
            # Get only https proxies
            SSP_HTTPS = True
        
        ## Tips
        
        I also find that rotating your user agent in _combination_ with this middleware can be helpful in minimising failures due to being banned!
