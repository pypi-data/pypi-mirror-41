        ====================
        
        SWH PyPI loader's source code repository
        
        # What does the loader do?
        
        The PyPI loader visits and loads a PyPI project [1].
        
        Each visit will result in:
        - 1 snapshot (which targets n revisions ; 1 per release artifact)
        - 1 revision (which targets 1 directory ; the release artifact uncompressed)
        
        [1] https://pypi.org/help/#packages
        
        ## First visit
        
        Given a PyPI project (origin), the loader, for the first visit:
        
        - retrieves information for the given project (including releases)
        - then for each associated release
        - for each associated source distribution (type 'sdist') release
          artifact (possibly many per release)
        - retrieves the associated artifact archive (with checks)
        - uncompresses locally the archive
        - computes the hashes of the uncompressed directory
        - then creates a revision (using PKG-INFO metadata file) targeting
          such directory
        - finally, creates a snapshot targeting all seen revisions
          (uncompressed PyPI artifact and metadata).
        
        ## Next visit
        
        The loader starts by checking if something changed since the last
        visit.  If nothing changed, the visit's snapshot is left
        unchanged. The new visit targets the same snapshot.
        
        If something changed, the already seen release artifacts are skipped.
        Only the new ones are loaded. In the end, the loader creates a new
        snapshot based on the previous one. Thus, the new snapshot targets
        both the old and new PyPI release artifacts.
        
        ## Terminology
        
        - 1 project: a PyPI project (used as swh origin). This is a collection
                     of releases.
        
        - 1 release: a specific version of the (PyPi) project. It's a
                     collection of information and associated source release
                     artifacts (type 'sdist')
        
        - 1 release artifact: a source release artifact (distributed by a PyPI
                              maintainer). In swh, we are specifically
                              interested by the 'sdist' type (source code).
        
        ## Edge cases
        
        - If no release provides release artifacts, those are skipped
        
        - If a release artifact holds no PKG-INFO file (root at the archive),
          the release artifact is skipped.
        
        - If a problem occurs during a fetch action (e.g. release artifact
          download), the load fails and the visit is marked as 'partial'.
        
        # Development
        
        ## Configuration file
        
        ### Location
        
        Either:
        - /etc/softwareheritage/
        - ~/.config/swh/
        - ~/.swh/
        
        Note: Will call that location $SWH_CONFIG_PATH
        
        ### Configuration sample
        
        $SWH_CONFIG_PATH/loader/pypi.yml:
        ```
        storage:
          cls: remote
          args:
            url: http://localhost:5002/
        
        ```
        
        ## Local run
        
        The built-in command-line will run the loader for a project in the
        main PyPI archive.
        
        For instance, to load arrow:
        ``` sh
        python3 -m swh.loader.pypi.loader arrow
        ```
        
        If you need more control, you can use the loader directly. It expects
        three arguments:
        - project: a PyPI project name (f.e.: arrow)
        - project_url: URL of the PyPI project (human-readable html page)
        - project_metadata_url: URL of the PyPI metadata information
          (machine-parsable json document)
        
        ``` python
        import logging
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
        
        from swh.loader.pypi.tasks import LoadPyPI
        
        project='arrow'
        
        LoadPyPI().run(project, 'https://pypi.org/pypi/%s/' % project, 'https://pypi.org/pypi/%s/json' % project)
        ```
