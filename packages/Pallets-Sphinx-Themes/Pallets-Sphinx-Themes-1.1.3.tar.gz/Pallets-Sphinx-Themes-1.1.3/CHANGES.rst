Version 1.1.0
=============

Released 2018-08-28

-   Modernize ``click`` theme. The ``.. click:example::`` and
    ``.. click:run::`` directives used by Click are available and ported
    to Python 3.
-   Modernize ``werkzeug`` theme. (`#4`_)
-   Modernize ``jinja`` theme. Local extensions used by Jinja are not
    available yet.
-   Remove theme entry points to make late configuration consistent. The
    themes are available when ``"pallets_sphinx_themes"`` is added to
    ``extensions``.
-   Only run event callbacks added by theme when the theme is actually
    in use. This allows the package to be installed without interfering
    with other themes.
-   Support ``html_context["versions"]`` in the format injected by
    Read the Docs.
-   Set ``html_context["readthedocs_docsearch"]`` to opt in to replacing
    Sphinx's built-in search with Read the Docs' new implementation.
-   Make version handling more robust for various configurations.
-   Autodoc skips docstrings that contain the line ``:internal:``.
-   Autodoc removes lines that start with ``:copyright:`` or
    ``:license:`` from module docstrings.
-   Add ``singlehtml_sidebars`` config for Sphinx < 1.8.
-   Add ``hide-header`` CSS class to hide the page header with
    ``.. rst-class:: hide-header``. The header is still useable by
    assistive technology. This is useful for replacing the header with a
    large logo image.
-   Disable the sidebar logo on the index page with
    ``html_theme_options["index_sidebar_logo"] = False``.

Version 1.0.0
=============

Released 2018-04-18

-   Major rewrite of CSS and HTML templates to clean up and reduce
    complexity. Widen columns, improve responsive breakpoints. Currently
    all themes are available, but only ``pocoo`` and ``flask`` themes
    are modernized.
-   Parse ``html_context["versions"]``. These will be rendered in the
    ``versions.html`` sidebar. When viewing an old version, or the
    development version, a warning is displayed at the top of each page.
-   Add a ``ProjectLink`` named tuple. A list of these in
    ``html_context["project_links"]`` will be rendered in the
    ``project.html`` sidebar.
-   Add a ``get_version`` function to ensure a project is installed and
    get its version information.
-   Use ``html_context["canonical_url"]`` as a base URL to build a
    canonical URL link on each page.
-   Add Sphinx entry points for themes.
-   Rename from "pocoo-sphinx-themes". See commit `f675bfc`_ for the old
    themes from the docbuilder.
