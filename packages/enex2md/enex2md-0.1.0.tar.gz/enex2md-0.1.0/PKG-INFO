Description: # enex2md
        
        Enex2md is a command-line utility to convert Evernote export files (`*.enex`) to Markdown.
        
        In addition to the content itself, most of the metadata is included in the resulting Markdown.
        
        Known issues:
        
        - Tables are not handled / verified
        - Lists are not handled / verified
        - Attachments are not handled at all
        - Tasks are not handled / verified
        - Bold and italic text is not handled correctly.
        
        **This is work in progress, but should already generate useful results.**
        
        ## Installation
        
        Preferably in *a virtual environment*, run:
        
        `pip install -U enex2md`
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use the CLI after installing, run the conversion with:
        
        `enex2md [enex-file-to-process]`
        
        The output is written to `STDOUT` by default. If you want to write to disk instead, add a flag `--disk` to the command. This option will create a directory based on run time timestamp, and place individual files under that.
        
        ## Development
        
        Clone the [repository](https://github.com/janikarh/enex2md) to your local machine.
        
        *I strongly recommend using a virtual environment for development.*
        
        Install the requirements with:
        
        `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        
        From the root of the repository, you can run the app with:
        
        `python -m enex2md.cli foo.enex`
        
        After editing the content, try to install the package locally with:
        
        `python setup.py install`
        
        See that everything works. You can uninstall the dev package with `pip uninstall enex2md`.
