        processes something like net[0] += Net() as follows::

            1. Pin.__getitem__ is called with '0' as the index. This
               returns a single Pin.

               method makes the actual connection to the net. Then
               it creates an iadd_flag attribute in the object it returns.
            3. Finally, Pin.__setitem__ is called. If the iadd_flag attribute
               is true in the passed argument, then __setitem__ was entered
               as part of processing the += operator. If there is no
