Description: # EcPc: Simple creation and managment of EC2 instances
        
        EcPc provides a small collection of command-line tools to launch, list,
        log in to, and terminate EC2 (spot) instances. 
        
        It's deliberately a basic
        tool with few parameters for a user to tweak.
        
        ## Prerequisites:
        
        You need to have an AWS account, and have you ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_ACCESS_KEYs to hand. Then install boto3 according to the 
        instructions [here](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/)
        
        ## Installation:
        
        Via `pip`:
        
            pip install ecpc
        
        ## Usage:
        
        To launch an instance, use `ecpc create`:
        
            % ecpc create
            creating a t2.small instance in region eu-west-1 with ID d830a8f4
            key pair created
            security group created
            required ami identified
            launching instance - this may take some time...
            instance launched
            %
        
        You can give it a nicer name, change the instance type, and the region it is launched into:
        
            % ecpc create -r us-west-1 -t c5.large -n c5large-1
            creating a c5.large instance in region eu-west-1 with ID c5large-1
            key pair created
            security group created
            required ami identified
            launching instance - this may take some time...
            instance launched
            %
        
        To list your instances:
        
            % ecpc list
            ID         region     type      up_time   state       cost($)
            c5large-1  us-west-1  c5.large  00:00:00  booting-up  0.00   
            d830a8f4   eu-west-1  t2.small  00:04:00  ready       0.00 
            
        **Note: the "cost" value is approximate**
        
        To log in to an instance, use `ecpc login`:
        
            % ecpc login d830a8f4
