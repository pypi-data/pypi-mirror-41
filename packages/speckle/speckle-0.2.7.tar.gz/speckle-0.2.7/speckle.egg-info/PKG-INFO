        ## Description
        
        PySpeckle is a light Python wrapper / interface for the Speckle framework. It can be used independently through Python scripts, or as a base for building various plug-ins, such as [SpeckleBlender](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleBlender). 
        
        At the moment, it copies the same method names from the .NET `SpeckleApiClient`, for consistency's sake. Although the functions are mostly labelled 'Async', they are not yet. This could eventually be implemented with `requests_futures` or `grequests` or similar.
        
        ## Notes
        SpeckleBlender is written and maintained by [Tom Svilans](http://tomsvilans.com) ([Github](https://github.com/tsvilans)).
