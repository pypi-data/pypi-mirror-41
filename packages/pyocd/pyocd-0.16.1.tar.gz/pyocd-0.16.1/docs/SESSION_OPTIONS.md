Session Options
===============

This guide documents the session options that are supported by pyOCD and how to use them.

Many of these options have dedicated command line arguments. Arbitrary options can be set
individually with the `-Ooption=value` command line argument. You may also use a YAML config file to
set multiple options. And if you are using the Python API, you may pass any session options directly
to the `ConnectHelper` methods or `Session` constructor as keyword arguments.

## Config file

pyOCD supports a YAML configuration file that lets you provide session options that either apply to
all probes or to a single probe, based on the probe's unique ID.

The easiest way to use a config file is to place a `pyocd.yaml` file in the working directory where
you run the `pyocd` tool. Alternatively, you can use the `--config` command line option, for instance
`--config=myconfig.yaml`. Finally, you can set the `config_file` session option.

The top level of the YAML file is a dictionary. The keys in the top-level dictionary must be names
of session options, or the key `probes`. Session options are set to the value corresponding to the
dictionary entry. Unrecognized option names are ignored.

If there is a top-level `probes` key, its value must be a dictionary with keys that match a
substring of debug probe unique IDs. Usually you would just use the complete unique ID shown by
listing connected boards (i.e., `pyocd list`). The values for the unique ID entries are
dictionaries containing session options, just like the top level of the YAML file. Of course, these
session options are only applied when connecting with the given probe. If the probe unique ID
substring listed in the config file matches more than one probe, the corresponding session options
will be applied to all matching probes.

Options set in the config file will override any options set via the command line.

Example board config file:
````yaml
probes:
  066EFF555051897267233656: # Probe's unique ID.
    target_override:  stm32l475xg
    test_binary:      stm32l475vg_iot01a.bin

# Global options
auto_unlock: false
frequency: 8000000 # Set 8 MHz SWD default for all probes
````


## Options list

- `auto_unlock`: (bool) If the target is locked, it will by default be automatically mass erased in
    order to gain debug access. Set this option to False to disable auto unlock. Default is True.

- `config_file`: (str) Relative path to a YAML config file that lets you specify session options
    either globally or per probe. The format of the file is documented above. The default is a
    `pyocd.yaml` or `pyocd.yml` file in the working directory.

- `enable_multicore_debug`: (bool) Whether to put pyOCD into multicore debug mode. The primary effect
    is to modify the default software reset type for secondary cores to use VECTRESET, which will
    fall back to emulated reset if the secondary core is not v7-M.

- `frequency`: (int) SWD/JTAG frequency in Hertz. Default is 1 MHz.

- `halt_on_connect`: (bool) Whether to halt the target immediately upon connecting. Default is True.

- `pack`: (str or list of str) Path or list of paths to CMSIS Device Family Packs. Devices defined
    in the pack(s) are added to the list of available targets.

- `reset_type`: (str) Which type of reset to use by default (one of 'default', 'hw', 'sw', 'sw_sysresetreq',
    'sw_vectreset', 'sw_emulated'). The default is 'sw'.

- `resume_on_disconnect`: (bool) Whether to resume a halted target when disconnecting. Default is True.

- `target_override`: (str) Target type name to use instead of default board target or default `cortex_m`.

- `test_binary`: (str) Specify the test binary file name used by the functional test suite (in the
    `test/` directory). The binary must be in the `binaries/` directory. This option is most useful
    when set in a board config file for running the functional tests on boards that cannot be
    automatically detected.


## GDB server options list

These session options are currently only applied when running the GDB server.

- `chip_erase`: (bool) Whether to perform a chip erase or sector erases when programming
    flash. If not set, pyOCD will use the fastest erase method.

- `enable_semihosting`: (bool) Set to True to handle semihosting requests. Also see the
    `semihost_console_type` option. Default is False.

- `fast_program`: (bool) Setting this option to True will use CRC checks of existing flash sector
    contents to determine whether pages need to be programmed. Default is False.

- `gdbserver_port`: (int) Base TCP port for the gdbserver. The core number, which is 0 for the
    primary core, will be added to this value. Default is 3333.

- `hide_programming_progress`: (bool) Disables flash programming progress bar when True. Default is
    False.

- `persist`: (bool) If True, the GDB server will not exit after GDB disconnects. Default is False.

- `report_core_number`: (bool) Whether gdb server should report core number as part of the
    per-thread information. Default is False.

- `semihost_console_type`: (str) If set to "telnet" then the semihosting telnet server will be
    started, otherwise semihosting will print to the console. Default is "telnet".

- `semihost_use_syscalls`: (bool) Whether to use GDB syscalls for semihosting file access operations,
    or to have pyOCD perform the operations. This is most useful if GDB is running on a remote
    system. Default is False.

- `serve_local_only`: (bool) When this option is True, the GDB server and semihosting telnet ports
    are only served on localhost, making them inaccessible across the network. If False, you can
    connect to these ports from any machine that is on the same network. Default is True.

- `soft_bkpt_as_hard`: (bool) Whether to force all breakpoints to be hardware breakpoints. Default
    is False.

- `step_into_interrupt`: (bool) Set this option to True to enable interrupts when performing step
    operations. Otherwise interrupts will be disabled and step operations cannot be interrupted.
    Default is False.

- `telnet_port`: (int) Base TCP port number for the semihosting telnet server. The core number,
    which will be 0 for the primary core, is added to this value. Default is 4444.

- `vector_catch`: (str) Enable vector catch sources, one letter per enabled source in any order, or
    `all` or `none`.

    The source letters are:
    - `h`=hard fault
    - `b`=bus fault
    - `m`=mem fault
    - `i`=irq err
    - `s`=state err
    - `c`=check err
    - `p`=nocp
    - `r`=reset
    - `a`=all
    - `n`=none

    Default is only hard fault enabled.
