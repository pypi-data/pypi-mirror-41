    Generate sample timeseries

    :param length: number of observations
    :return: date-based time series of randomly generated prices

    **Usage**

    Create timeseries from returns generated from a normally distributed random variables (IDD). Length determines the
    number of observations to be generated.

    Assume random variables :math:`R` which follow a normal distribution with mean :math:`0` and standard deviation
    of :math:`1`

    :math:`R \sim N(0, 1)`

    The timeseries is generated from these random numbers through:

    :math:`X_t = (1 + R)X_{t-1}`

    **Examples**

    Generate price series with 100 observations starting from today's date:

    >>> prices = generate_series(100)

    **Usage**

    For each element in the series, :math:`X_t`, raise :math:`e` (Euler's number) to the power of :math:`X_t`.
    Euler's number is the base of the natural logarithm, :math:`ln`.

    :math:`Y_t = e^{X_t}`

    **Examples**

    Raise :math:`e` to the power :math:`1`. Returns Euler's number, approximately 2.71828

    The natural logarithm is the logarithm in base :math:`e`.

    :math:`Y_t = log(X_t)`
