Description: # Lyon's auditory model for Python
        Python port of Lyon's model calculation from Auditory Toolbox.
        Original version of Auditory Toolbox is written in C and MATLAB by Malcolm Slaney.
        
        ## Package contents
        * Modified `soscascade.c`, `agc.c` and `sosfilters.c` (removed MEX-related part).
        * `ctypes` wrapper for `soscascade()`, `agc()` and `sosfilters()` calls.
        * Translation from MATLAB to Python for files necessary for successfull call to `LyonPassiveEar()`.
        
        ## Dependecies
        If you plan to build manually and run tests, you'll need `libcheck` installed.
        On Ubuntu 18.10 run:
        
        ``` bash
        sudo apt-get install check
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        ### Manual
        Build a library:
        
        ``` bash
        make lib
        ```
        
        This would result in `liblyon.so` shared library. Verify that library is properly built by running a test suite:
        
        ``` bash
        make test
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        The following code computes cochleogram for a sample sound:
        
        ``` python
        from lyon import LyonCalc
        
        calc = LyonCalc()
        waveform, sample_rate = load('audio/file/path.wav')
        decimation_factor = 64
        coch = calc.lyon_passive_ear(waveform, sample_rate, decimation_factor)
        print(coch.shape)
        ```
        
        The code above should output shape of resulting auditory nerve response: `[<number of samples / decimation_factor>, 86]`.
        
        See `lyon_examples.py` for examples on running other functions.
