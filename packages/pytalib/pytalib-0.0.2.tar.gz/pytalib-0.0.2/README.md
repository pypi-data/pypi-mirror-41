# pytalib
Pytalib is a python technical analysis library developed CMSC5720 project group which support various types of technical indicators. Pytalib adapts object oriented paradigm that each indicator is represented as an object. Unlike function-based library, using objects allow us to store some intermediate variables, for example Average gain/loss in RSI. This improves flexibility if we want to do further analysis on indicators.

## Visibility Graph Algorithm
Implementations the following time series-to-graph algorithm which takes the time series as parameter and returns a networkx undirected graph.

## Correlation analysis
Implementation of multiscale horizontal-visibility-graph correlation analysis (MHVGCA) that utilised horizontal visibility graph and degree sequence similarity to estimate the correlation between time series under specific time scale.

## Example Code
#### Calculate indicators
```
from pytalib.indicators.trend import SimpleMovingAverage

prices = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
sma = SimpleMovingAverage(prices=prices, period=3)
result = sma.calculate()

# reuse sma object
prices2 = [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
sma.reset(prices=prices2, period=3)
result2 = sma.calculate()
```

#### Time series-to-Graph transformation
```
import networkx as nx
from pytalib.graph import visibility_graph as vg
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')

prices = [1,3,2,4,5,6,9,8,9,10]
G = vg.ts2vg_fast(prices)
nx.draw_networkx(G, with_labels=True, font_weight='bold')
plt.title('visibility graph of prices')
plt.show()
```
