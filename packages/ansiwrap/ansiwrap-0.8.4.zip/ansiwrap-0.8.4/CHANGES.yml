  notes: >
    Updated testing matrix.

-
  version: 0.8.3
  date: June 14, 2017
  notes: >
    Fixed edge case in  `shorten()` reported by
    `MinchinWeb <https://github.com/MinchinWeb>`_

-
  version: 0.8.2
  date: June 11, 2017
  notes: >
    Tweaked ``setup.py``. Packaging now makes ``textwrap3`` an install, not
    setup, requirement. Thanks to `MinchinWeb <https://github.com/MinchinWeb>`_
    for observing & fixing.

  version: 0.8.1

  notes: >
    Improved README and tests.
  
    
-
  version: 0.8.0
  date: June 7, 2017
  notes: >
    Updated packaging strategy to repair install-ability issues that
    cropped up in recent releases. Both local and CI tests installed and
    ran code fine, but real-world installs had more trouble. Testing
    config hardened to make recurrence of that discrepancy less likely.
    
    Excised local copy of ``textwrap`` to ``textwrap3``, which is now
    a stand-alone module on PyPI.

-
  version: 0.7.2
  date: June 6, 2017
  notes: >
    Minor code clean-up.
    
    Test coverage upped to 99%. Point of pride:
    Has better test coverage for embedded version
    of ``textwrap`` than the Python standard
    distribution does.

-
  version: 0.7.1
  date: June 4, 2017
  notes: >
    ``shorten()`` API now works across all Python versions,
    including with ANSI codes embedded.
    
    Revised coverage metric to 97 after major code infusion.

-
  version: 0.7.0
  date: June 4, 2017
  notes: >
    Now includes a copy of the Python 3.6 ``textwrap`` as
    ``ansiwrap.textwrap``.  Its testing module was also
    added. Both were slightly tweaked to support Python 2.6
    forward. But now there's a quality, tested version of
    the Python 3.6 ``textwrap`` back-ported to 2.x.
    
    ``textwrap`` has been made savvy to Unicode emdashes,
    which it surprisingly was not before.

-
  version: 0.6.0
  date: June 3, 2017
  notes: >
    Upgraded monkey-patching strategy to make a copy of the ``textwrap``
    module using ``imp``. We are only patching a copy, so safer, esp.
    with concurrency.
    
    ``shorten`` API added for 3.4 and following.

-
  version: 0.5.5
  date: June 3, 2017
  notes: >
    Extended ``ansilen()`` to handle cases where it is used
    for length of lists and other non-string objects. This
    is in service of making the function a better and more
    robust version of ``len()`` for monkey-patching.

-
  version: 0.5.2
  date: May 23, 2017
  notes: >
    Fixed bug that slipped through previous tests.

-
  version: 0.5.0
  date: May 23, 2017
  notes: >
    First release. ``wrap`` and ``fill`` complete. 100% test
    line coverage.
