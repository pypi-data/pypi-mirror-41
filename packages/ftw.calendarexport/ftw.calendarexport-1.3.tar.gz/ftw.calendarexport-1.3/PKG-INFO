Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``ftw.calendarexport`` provides the functionality to export multiple events as ICS from ftw.calendar.
          
          It uses simplelayout to manage and display the content.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        - Add ``ftw.calendarexport`` to your buildout configuration:
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ftw.calendarexport
        
        - Install the generic import profile.
        
        On the ftwcalendar_view view you now see a viewlet which enables you to export multiple Events between a certain time.
