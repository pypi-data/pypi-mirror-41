        ==============
        ### Introduction

        `pip install ftir_renamer`
        
        ### Requirements
        - Unix-like environment
        - Spreadsheet of FTIR-related metadata
        - The .FTIR output files corresponding to the FTIR IDs in the spreadsheet
        
        ### Required Arguments
        
        -s
        The path of the folder containing the FTIR output files
        -f 
        Absolute path to the spreadsheet containing the FTIR metadata
        -o
        The absolute path of the folder to store the renamed files
        
        ### Running 
        
        ##### Example command to run the script
        
        `renamer.py -f /path/to/FTIR.xlsx -s /path/to/files -o /path/to/outputs`
            
        ##### Usage
        
        ```
        usage: renamer.py [-h] -s SEQUENCEPATH -f FILENAME -o OUTPUTPATH
        
        Rename files for FTIR experiments using strict naming scheme
        
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        required arguments:
          -s SEQUENCEPATH, --sequencepath SEQUENCEPATH
                                Path of .spc files to process.
          -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME
