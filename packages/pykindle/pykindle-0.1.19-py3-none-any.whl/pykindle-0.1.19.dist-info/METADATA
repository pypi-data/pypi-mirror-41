# pykindle

A library to make book.mobi files.

Kindlegen packaged all the functions in a file,
 and here we'd like to develop it's python API.

# Install

`pip install pykindle`

Please get kindlegen from amazon website and 

# Documentation

[documentation](https://pykindle.readthedocs.io)

# Usage

```python
import pykindle
book = pykindle.MagazineBook()
article = pykindle.MarkdownArticleItem()
article.href = 'page1.html'
article.source = 'This is a page.'
book.append(article)
book_bytes = book.create()
with open('output.mobi', mode='wb') as file:
    file.write(book_bytes)
```

For example, click [here][magazine_example].

# Not finished yet

There are so many functions that haven't been implemented yet.

Currently, PyKindle only support to generate a magazine format book without photos.

# Need help

I'm new in open source, and many people help me,
so if you want to join my project, tell me,
and I'll try my best to help you.

As a previous version,
you can change the APIs,
you can add anything you like.

I hope to make pykindle the best kindle library.

If you are also new here,
help me to create documentation, create testcases, or translate the documentation.
