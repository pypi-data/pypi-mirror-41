Description: 
        	When a plane wave encounters a perfect sphere then some of the light will
        	be absorbed and some will be scattered.  Mie developed the equations that
        	describe the scattered light wave.  These equations are complicated and 
        	involve infinite sums of Bessel functions.  Not surprisingly, calculating
        	the scattered profiles is complicated and easily gotten wrong.  Fortunately
        	Wiscombe identified the challenges and implemented these in Fortran code.
        	
        	This code is pure python and uses many of the ideas that Wiscombe developed
        	and published in papers and in Fortran code.  This code has been validated
        	against that of Wiscombe.
        	
        	This code provides python functions for calculating the extinction efficiency,
        	scattering efficiency, backscattering, and scattering asymmetry.  Moreover, a
        	set of angles can be given and the scattering will be calculated for each angle.
