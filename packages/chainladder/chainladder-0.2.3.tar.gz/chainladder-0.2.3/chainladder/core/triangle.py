class Triangle(TriangleBase):
    """
    The core data structure of the chainladder package

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : DataFrame
        A single dataframe that contains columns represeting all other
        arguments to the Triangle constructor
    origin : str or list
         A representation of the accident, reporting or more generally the
         origin period of the triangle that will map to the Origin dimension
    development : str or list
        A representation of the development/valuation periods of the triangle
        that will map to the Development dimension
    columns : str or list
        A representation of the numeric data of the triangle that will map to the
        columns dimension.  If None, then a single 'Total' key will be generated.
    index : str or list or None
        A representation of the index of the triangle that will map to the
        index dimension.  If None, then a single 'Total' key will be generated.

    Attributes
    ----------
    index
        Represents all available levels of the index dimension.
    columns
        Represents all available levels of the value dimension.
    origin

    link_ratio, age_to_age
        Set of age-to-age ratios for the triangle.
    valuation_date
        The latest valuation date of the data
    loc
        pandas-style `loc` accessor
    iloc
        pandas-style `iloc` accessor
