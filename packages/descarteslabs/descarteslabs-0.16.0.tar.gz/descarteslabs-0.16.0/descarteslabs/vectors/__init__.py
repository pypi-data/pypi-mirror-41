"""
The Descartes Labs Vector service allows you store vector features (points, polygons, etc.)
with associated key-value properties, and query that data by geometry or by properties.

It works best at the scale of millions of features. For small amounts of vector data
that easily fit in memory, working directly with a GeoJSON file or similar may be more efficient.

* :doc:`Feature <docs/feature>`: an object following the GeoJSON format
* :doc:`FeatureCollection <docs/featurecollection>`: a convenient helper class for working with
    millions of features

It's available under ``descarteslabs.vectors``.
