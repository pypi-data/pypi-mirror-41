Description: NATO
        -------------------
        
        One letter variables thoughtlessly strewed about a codebase annoyed a colleague and an idle thought became this poorly named project.
        
        Uses the AST (and some cool projects like `Astor` and `codegen.py`) to quickly mangle / transform your code.
        
        Why not just rename the variable and be done with it?
        =========================================================
        Excellent question!  It's fun to play at the A.S.T.!
