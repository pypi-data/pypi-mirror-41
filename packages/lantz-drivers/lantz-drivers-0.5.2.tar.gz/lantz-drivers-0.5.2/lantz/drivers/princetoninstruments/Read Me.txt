    Implementation of Winspec PI Camera over a Socket

"""

This driver is designed for a Princeton Instruments ST - 133 driver. This device is old (and expensive) - it will only run on a windows xp or vista 32 bits.
THERE ARE NO 64 BIT DRIVERS - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME LOOKING FOR IT. Instead have a designated computer with Winspec and basic python installed.
Place the python files in any folder in the designated computer - and simply run VirtualWinSpec.py by double clicking and then create a Lantz driver
by calling the address "TCPIP::<IP Address>::<Port Number>::SOCKET". If no connection is established the local machine will timeout in 5 minutes.
Everything should work smoothly.

Have fun.
