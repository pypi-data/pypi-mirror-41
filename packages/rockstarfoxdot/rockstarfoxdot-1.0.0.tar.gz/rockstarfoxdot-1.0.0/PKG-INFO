        Using using the RockStar EsoLang to make music in FoxDot
        
        ## To install (I think)
         * use python3
         * pip3 install numpy timeout_decorator watchdog rockstarfoxdot
         * pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/yanorestes/rockstar-py.git
        
        ### Instructions
        
        Start up FoxDot as normal
        
        Before trying to run any Rockstar run this line
        
        ```
        from rockstarfoxdot import *
        ```
        
        
        #### rockstar(lyrics, namespace=None, printname=None)
        Use rockstar in-line
        ```
        rockstar('''
        Papa was a rolling stone
        ''', locals())
        ```
        
        When run this will exec this python in your FoxDot
        ```
        Papa = 175
        ```
        
        #### rockstar(filename, namespace=None, printname=None)
        Use rockstar from a file
        ```
        rsf("FizzBuzz.rock", locals(), "fizzbuzz")
        p1 >> bass(fizzbuzz, dur=PDur(17, 24))
        ```
        
        When run this will exec the rockstar from "FizzBuzz.rock" in your FoxDot and place anything you 'Shout'ed 'Said' or 'Scream'ed into a list called fizzbuzz.
        
        Then it will play those notes on the bass in FoxDot player p1
        
        **rockstar()** has a timeout protecting you from infinite loops in the code
        
        
        
        #### rs(lyrics, namespace=None, printname=None)
        Use rockstar in-line
        ```
        rockstar('''
        Papa was a rolling stone
        ''', locals())
        ```
        
        When run this will exec this python in your FoxDot
        ```
        Papa = 175
        ```
        
        #### rsf(filename, namespace=None, printname=None)
        Use rockstar from a file
        ```
        rsf("FizzBuzz.rock", locals(), "fizzbuzz")
        p1 >> bass(fizzbuzz, dur=PDur(17, 24))
        ```
        
        When run this will exec the rockstar from "FizzBuzz.rock" in your FoxDot and place anything you 'Shout'ed 'Said' or 'Scream'ed into a list called fizzbuzz.
        
        Then it will play those notes on the bass in FoxDot player p1
        
        **rsf()** has a timeout protecting you from infinite loops in the rockstar
