        A python toolbox for writing macOS sandbox profiles.
        
        ## installation
        
        ````
        pip3 install buckle-up
        ````
        
        ## monitor all sandbox events
        
        ````
        bu -p all
        ````
        
        ## monitor sandbox events for specific processes
        
        ````
        bu -p 'Slack,Slack Helper'
        ````
        
        ## write denied actions to a sandbox profile file
        
        ````
        bu -p 'Slack,Slack Helper' -o slack.sb
        ````
        
        ## known issues
        
        deny events are de-duped but written verbatim from the system log into the
        output sandbox profile. this means that all file references are entered as
        "literal" and other actions such as signals will not be in a valid format so
        some manual tidying will be necessary.
