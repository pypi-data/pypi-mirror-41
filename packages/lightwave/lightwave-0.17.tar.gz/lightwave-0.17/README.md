# lightwave
Python library to provide a realiable communication link with LightWaveRF lights and switches.

# Installation
Either clone this resposition and run `python setup.py install`, or install from pip using `pip install lightwave`.

# API
This library makes use of the public API provided by lightwave that can be found here: https://api.lightwaverf.com/lighting_power.html

The library supports the following functions:
```
turn_on_light(device_id, name)
turn_on_switch(device_id, name)
turn_on_with_brightness(device_id, name, brightness)
turn_off(device_id, name)
```
Where:
* **device_id** takes the form **R#D#** where **R#** is the room number and **D#** is the device number.
* **name** is the text that will be displayed on the hub.
* **brightness** is a value from 0 (off) to 255 (full on).

# Usage
Initialise a link to the hub by passing in the IP address required. Then call a method on the object to modify the device.
The first time a switch is turned on or off the device will attempt to pair to the hub. This should then show a message on your WiFi Link asking you to pair the device. You have 12 seconds to push the button on the WiFi Link to accept this.

    lwLink = LWLink('192.168.15.226')

    print("Off")
    ### R1D3 is room 1 device 3
    lwLink.turn_off('R1D3', "Wall Lights")
    lwLink.turn_off('R1D4', "Ceiling Lights")

    time.sleep(5)
    print("On")
    lwLink.turn_on_light('R1D3', "Wall Lights")

    lwLink.turn_on_with_brightness('R1D3', "Wall Lights", 25)
    lwLink.turn_on_with_brightness('R1D4', "Ceiling Lights", 50)
    lwLink.turn_on_switch('R1D1', "Sockets one")
    lwLink.turn_on_switch('R1D2', "Sockets two")
