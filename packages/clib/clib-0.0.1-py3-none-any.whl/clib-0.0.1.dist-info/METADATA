clib
=====

clib is intended a base on top of which to build CLIs.

It uses [click](https://click.pocoo.org) and aims to provide some utilities on
top of it to make build CLIs faster and easier.

One core goal of clib is to provide a reasonably standard interface for many
common tasks, to allow switching the (usually third party) libraries it uses
easily.

Although primarily intended as a library, it provides some simple commands of
its own.

Installing
----------

```
pip install clib
```
