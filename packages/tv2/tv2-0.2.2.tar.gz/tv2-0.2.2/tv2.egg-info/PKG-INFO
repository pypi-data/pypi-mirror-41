Description: # Terminal Velocity 2
        
        Terminal Velocity 2 is a fast note-taking app for the UNIX terminal, that focuses on letting you create or find a note as quickly and easily as possible, then uses your `$EDITOR` to open and edit the note. It is heavily inspired by the OS X app [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/). For screenshots and features, see the [Terminal Velocity website](https://github.com/terminal-velocity-notes/terminal_velocity).

        Then to launch it just run:
        
            tv2
        
        To use a different notes directory, run:
        
            tv2 path/to/your/notes/dir
