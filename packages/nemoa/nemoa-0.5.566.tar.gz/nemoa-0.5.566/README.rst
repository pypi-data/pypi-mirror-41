Nemoa
=====

*Nemoa* is a data analysis framework for collaborative data science and
enterprise application. Nemoa is open source and based on the `Python`_
programming language.

The key goal of nemoa is to provide a long-term data analysis framework, which
seemingly integrates into existing enterprise data environments and thereby
supports collaborative data science. To achieve this goal *nemoa* orchestrates
established frameworks like `TensorFlow®`_ and `SQLAlchemy`_ and dynamically
extends their capabilities by **community driven** algorithms for `probabilistic
graphical modeling`_, `machine learning`_ and `structured data-analysis`_.

Licensing and Installation
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Nemoa is available free for any use under the `GPLv3 license`_. For installation
instructions see the `documentation`_ page.
