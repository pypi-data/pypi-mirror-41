# Chester - Chess Engine Tester

`chester` is a Python package that aims to provide a simple interface for running chess matches
between computer chess programs (referred to as engines). It makes it easy to
play 1v1 matches of any length, including running tournaments between a large
set of engines.

__Note__: This is not yet complete.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how to run a 2-player tournament between
[Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) and
[Goldfish](https://github.com/bsamseth/Goldfish). All players must be UCI compatible
chess engines.

```python
from chester.timecontrol import TimeControl
from chester.tournament import play_tournament

players = ["stockfish", "goldfish"]  # Each string is the name/path to an executable UCI engine.
time_control = TimeControl(initial_time=2, increment=0)  # 2 seconds on the clock, 0 seconds increment.
n_games = 2

for pgn in play_tournament(players, time_control, n_games=n_games):
    print(pgn, '\n')  # Print out the PGN for each game as they finish.
```

Which could output something like this:

```

The result is `4` games are played. This is because the tournament will run
`n_games * len(list(permutations(players, 2)))!` games, i.e. each player plays
every other player both as white and as black, and all of this is repeated `n_games`
times.


## Alternatives

The most mentioned alternative to this is
[cutechess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess). The downside of cutechess
is that it is less portable, and depends on the Qt framework. This has its
benefits, but also means a lot of dependencies. This project aims to be much
more portable, and just depending on a compatible version of Python. It does
_not_, however, have any intentions of becoming _feature complete_ and
supporting everything imaginable. Its aim is to provide a simple way to do a
simple task - testing chess engines against each other.
