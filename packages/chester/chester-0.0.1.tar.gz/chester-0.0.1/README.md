# Chester - Chess Engine Tester

`chester` is a Python package that aims to provide a simple interface for running chess matches
between computer chess programs (referred to as engines). It makes it easy to
play 1v1 matches of any length, including running tournaments between a large
set of engines.

__Note__: This is not yet complete.

## Alternatives

The most mentioned alternative to this is
[cutechess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess). The downside of cutechess
is that it is less portable, and depends on the Qt framework. This has its
benefits, but also means a lot of dependencies. This project aims to be much
more portable, and just depending on a compatible version of Python. It does
_not_, however, have any intentions of becoming _feature complete_ and
supporting everything imaginable. Its aim is to provide a simple way to do a
simple task - testing chess engines against each other.
