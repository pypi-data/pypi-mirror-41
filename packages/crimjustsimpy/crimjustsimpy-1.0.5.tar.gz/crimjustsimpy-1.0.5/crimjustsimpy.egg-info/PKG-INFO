Description: # crimjustsimpy
        Tools for criminal justice simulation.
        
        ##Introduction
        This module contains a few classes that can help with simulating
        certain elements of the criminal justice system in the United States.
        
        At present, it only simululates cases that have a probabilistic outcome at trial,
        with an option to plea bargain that is solely a random choice. In the future,
        I hope to add more realistic simulation of how both prosecutors and defendants
        make plea bargaining decisions.
