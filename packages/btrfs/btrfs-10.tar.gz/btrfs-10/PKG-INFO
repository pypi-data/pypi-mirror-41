Description: python-btrfs
        ============
        
        Python 3 module to inspect btrfs filesystems.

        Btrfs is a copy on write (COW) filesystem for Linux aimed at implementing
        advanced features while focusing on fault tolerance, repair and easy
        administration.
        
        Project Goal
        ------------
        
        The primary goal of this module is to be able to inspect the internals of an
        existing filesystem for educational purposes.
        
        A second goal is to provide a nicer way for automating administration tasks and
        writing monitoring scripts by being able to just programmatically access the
        needed information, instead of having to spend most of the time on parsing
        human readable output from other btrfs tools.
        
        The python module acts as a wrapper around the low level kernel calls and btrfs
        data structures, presenting them as python objects with interesting attributes
        and references to other objects.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Reference documentation of the stable API of the library is written in Sphinx
        autodoc format. An [online version of the HTML
        documenation](https://python-btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs.html) is also
        available.
