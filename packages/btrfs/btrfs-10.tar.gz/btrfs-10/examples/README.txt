In this directory you can find a collection of example scripts that use
python-btrfs to look up information about your btrfs filesystem.

For all new added functionality, there should be at least one example script
that's using it.

Many of the scripts just use a btrfs mountpoint, or a combination of a vaddr
and mountpoint as argument. Run them without any of it, and they will tell you
what they expect.

More background information about every example can be found in the git commit
history of this project. Just find out when each of the files were added or
modified and when, and what other commits were done around that. Browsing
around in the commits will show a huge amount of documentation.

Have fun!
