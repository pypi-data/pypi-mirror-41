.TH URLSCAN 1 "January 14, 2019"

.SH NAME
urlscan \- browse the URLs in an email message from a terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBurlscan\fR [options] <
.I message

\fBurlscan\fR [options]
.I message

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBurlscan\fR accepts a single email message on standard
input, then displays a terminal-based list of the URLs in the given
message.  Selecting a URL uses the Python webbrowser module to 
determine which browser to open. The \fBBROWSER\fR environment 
variable will be used if it is set.

\fBurlscan\fR is primarily intended to be used with the
.B mutt
(1) mailreader, but it should work well with any terminal-based mail
program.

\fBurlscan\fR is similar to \fBurlview\fR(1), but has the following
additional features:

\fB1.\fR Support for more message encodings, such as quoted-printable
and base64.

\fB2.\fR Extraction and display of the context surrounding each URL. Toggle
context view on/off with `c`.

\fB3.\fR Copy current URL to clipboard primary selection with `C`.

\fB4.\fR URLs are shortened by default to fit on one line. Toggle one or all
shortened URLs with `s` or `S`.

\fB5.\fR Incremental case-insensitive search using `/`. Footer shows current
search term. `/` again resets search.

\fB6.\fR Cycle through all available palettes (color and black & white available
by default) using `p`. `P` will generate a ~/.config/urlscan/config.json file
for editing or adding additional pallettes. See

http://urwid.org/manual/displayattributes.html#display-attributes

for options and allowed values.

\fB7.\fR `u` will unescape the highlighted URL if necessary.

\fB8.\fR Run a command with the selected URL as the argument or pipe the selected
  URL to a command using the `--run` and `--pipe` arguments.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-compact
Display a simple list of the extracted URLs, instead of showing the
context of each URL. Also toggle with `c` from within the viewer.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-dedupe
Remove duplicated URLs from the list of URLs.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no-browser
Disables the selection interface and print the links to standard output.
Useful for scripting (implies \fB\-\-compact\fR).
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-run \<expression\>
Execute \<expression\> in place of opening URL with a browser. Use {} in
\<expression\> to substitute in the URL. Example:

    $ urlscan --run 'echo {} | xclip -i' file.txt
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pipe
Pipe the selected URL to the command specified by `--run`. This is preferred
when the command supports it, as it is more secure and tolerant of special
characters in the URL. Example:

    $ urlscan --run 'xclip -i' --pipe file.txt

.SH MUTT INTEGRATION

To integrate urlscan with mutt, include the following two commands in
\fB~/.muttrc\fR:


.ad l
macro index,pager \\cb "<pipe-message> urlscan<Enter>" "call urlscan to extract URLs out of a message"

macro attach,compose \\cb "<pipe-entry> urlscan<Enter>" "call urlscan to extract URLs out of a message"
.ad b


Once these lines are in your mutt configuration file, pressing
Control-b will allow you to browse and open the URLs in the currently
selected message.

Alternately, you can pipe a message into urlscan using the '|' operator. This
can be useful for applying a different flag (such as the '-d' or '-c' options).

.SH FILES

$HOME/.config/urlscan/config.json

Only required if additional or modified palettes are desired.
