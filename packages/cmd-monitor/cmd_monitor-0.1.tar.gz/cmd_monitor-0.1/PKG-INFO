Description: Command Monitor
        ---------------
        
        This is a command line utility for reporting the status of a long-running job.
        This project started because the author got tired of building ``c++`` code and
        having to choose between staring at a screen while waiting for the job to end
        or starting another task only to come back much after a job had ended. With
        this utility, instead of typing::
        
            $ make
        
        you can instead type:: 
        
            $ cmd_monitor.py "make"
        
        When the make job ends, a status notification will show up on your desktop
        along with a sound indicating whether the job was successful or not.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            $ pip install cmd_monitor
        
        Additionally, the default sounds are provided on Ubuntu with the
        ``ubuntu-sounds`` package. Pulseaudio is used to play the sounds (from the package ``pulseaudio-utils``).
        If you are on another distribution, you can override
        the default sounds with the following flags::
        
            $ cmd_monitor --success_sound /my/success/sound --fail_sound /my/fail/sound
        
        Or to have no sound at all::
            
            $ cmd_monitor --success_sound "" --fail_sound ""
