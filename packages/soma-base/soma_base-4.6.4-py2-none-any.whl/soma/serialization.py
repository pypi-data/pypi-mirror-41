'''
Framework to serialize/deserialize Python objects in JSON. The main
feature of this framework is that deserialization of a JSON value requires
no other information than the JSON itself. It is not necessary to know the
class of the object to deserialize. This imposes that the serialization
contains a reference to a factory that is responsible to build the Python
object given its JSON.
'''

class JSONSerializable(object):
    '''
    Instances of classes deriving from `JSONSerializable` can be serialized
    in a JSON compatible object with :meth:`to_json` method. This JSON object
    contains a reference to a factory as well as the full state of the 
    instance. Calling the factory with the state of the instance makes it
    possible to recreate the instance (this is what function :func:`from_json`
    is doing). A typical usage of this serialization system is to store the
    JSON serialization of an instance in a configuration file (or database)
    and latter (possibly in another Python instance) recreate the same
    instance. This is an alternative to pickle allowing to use a standard
    representation format (JSON) and to have full control on instances
    creation.
    '''
    def to_json(self):
        '''
        Return a JSON serialization of self. The returned object can be given
        to :func:`from_json` to create another instance that is eqivalent to
        self.
        Here, equivalent means that all attributes values are the same and the
        methods called with the same parameters give the same results.

        See :func:`from_json` to have insight of what is a JSON serialization
        object.

def to_json(object):

    json.dumps whereas other type of object must define a to_json
    method returning the serialization.

def from_json(json_serialization):
    '''
    Takes a JSON serialization object (typically created by a
    :meth:`JSONSerializable.to_json` method) and create and return the
    corresponding instance.
    
    A JSON serialization object can have one of the following structures:
    - A simple string containing a factory reference
    - A list with one, two or three of the following items:

        - factory: a mandatory item containing a reference to a factory
          (see :func:`find_factory`)
        - args: an optional item containing a list of parameters values
          for the factory
        - kwargs: an optional item containing a dictionary of parameters
          for the factory
    
    A reference to a factory identifies a :class:`callable` (e.g a function or
    a class) in a Python module. It is a string containing the module name
    and the callable name separated by a dot. For instance 
    ``'catidb.data_models.catidb_3_4'`` would identify the *catidb_3_4*
    callable in the *catidb.data_models* module.
