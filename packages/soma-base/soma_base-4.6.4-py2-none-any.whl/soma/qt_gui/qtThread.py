This module enables to make a function to be executed in qt thread (main thread).
It is useful when you want to call qt functions from another thread.
It enables to do thread safe calls because all tasks sent are executed in the same thread (qt main thread).

    * acquire a lock

    * the main thread waits on the lock while holding a reference on the object
    * we delete the object in the calling thread
    * the lock is releasd from the calling thread
