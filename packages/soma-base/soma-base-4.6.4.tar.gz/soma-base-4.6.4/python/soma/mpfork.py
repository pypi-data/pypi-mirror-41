'''
Run worker functions in separate processes.

The use case is somewhat similar to what can be done using either :class:`queue.Queue <Queue.Queue>` and threads, or using :mod:`multiprocessing`. That is: run a number of independent job functions, dispatched over a number of worker threads/processes.

The mpfork module is useful in cases the above methods cannot work:

* threading in python is globally mainly inefficient because of the GIL.
* :mod:`multiprocessing` makes heavy use of pickles to pass objects and parameters, and there are cases we are using objects which cannot be pickled, or which pickling generates heavy IO traffic (large data objects)

The method here is based on the queue / thread schema, but uses fork() to actually execute the workers in a separate process. Only results are passed through pickles, so the worker return results must be picklable, but not the input arguments and objects.

Use:

* allocate a :class:`Queue <Queue.Queue>`
* allocate a results list with the exact size of the jobs number
* allocate a set of worker threads (typically one per processor or core). The function :func:`allocate_workers` can do this for you.
* fill the queue with jobs, each being a tuple (job_index, function, args, kwargs, results_list)
* add a number of empty jobs (None) to the queue, one per allocated worker: this will be the marker for the end of processing in each worker thread. It is necessary to explicitly add these empty jobs since an empty queue is not the signal for the end of processing: it can be re-filled at any time.
* jobs run in workers
* join the queue
* join the worker threads
* the result list gets the return data for each job

::

    njobs = 10
    q = queue.Queue()
    res = [None] * njobs
    workers = allocate_workers(q, 0) # one per core
    for i in range(njobs):
        job = (i, sum, ((i, i), ), {}, res)
        q.put(job)

    # add as many empty jobs as the workers number to end them
    for i in range(len(workers)):
        q.put(None)

    # wait for every job to complete
    q.join()
    # terminate all threads
    for w in workers:
        w.join()

    print('result:', res)

In case of error, the job result will be an exception with stack information: (exception type, exception instance, stack_info)
