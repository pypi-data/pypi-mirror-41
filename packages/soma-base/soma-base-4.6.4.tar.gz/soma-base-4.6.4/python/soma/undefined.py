:attr:`Undefined` (or :attr:`undefined`) is a constant that can be used as
a special value different from any other Python value including *None*.

If the :traits:`traits <index.html>` library is available, we just use its
:traits:`Undefined <traits_api_reference/trait_base.html#traits.trait_base.Undefined>` implementation.

Example::

    from soma.undefined import undefined

    if object.value is undefined:
        # do something
