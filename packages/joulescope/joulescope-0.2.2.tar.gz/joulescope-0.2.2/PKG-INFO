Description: 
        # Joulescope
        
        Welcome to Joulescope™!  Joulescope is an inexpensive, precision DC energy 
        analyzer that enables you to build better products.  
        Joulescope™ accurately and simultaneously measures the voltage and current 
        supplied to your target device, and it then computes power and energy. 
        For more information on Joulescope, see 
        [www.joulescope.com](https://www.joulescope.com).
        
        This pyjoulescope package contains the driver and command-line utilities that 
        run on a host PC and communicate with a Joulescope device over USB. 
        Most users will run the graphical user interface which is in the 
        pyjoulescope_ui package.  Developers may import this package to automate
        and script Joulescope operation. 
        The majority of code is written in Python 3.6+, but a small amount is in 
        Cython for better performance.
