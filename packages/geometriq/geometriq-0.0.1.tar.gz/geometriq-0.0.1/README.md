# Geometriq

Geometriq is an extensible library for creating 2D geometrical art.

It provides a single, unified API for creating a variety of shapes
and transforms, and abstracts away the implementation details of
numerous backend systems, including:

  * [CoreGraphics][coregraphics_link] (macOS and iOS)
  * Pythonista's [canvas module][canvas_link] (partial, for iOS)
  * [Pillow][pillow_link] (partial)
  * [PyX][pyx_link] (rudimentary)

As well as planned:

  * [Cairo][cairo_link] (on Linux, macOS, and Windows)
