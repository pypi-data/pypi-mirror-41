Description: # The configmount project
        
        Config is a tool to mount configuration files into your filesystem, so that you can navigate through the configuration hierarchy and access its values like files.
        
        ## Example
        
        Create a configuration directory for testing via `mkdir ~/etc` and place the following yaml file into it:
        
        ~/etc/config.yml
        ```yaml
        group:
          key: value
          another group:
            key: value
        ```
        
        Now create a mount directory `/mnt/etc` and mount the configuration directory into it.
        
        ```
        mkdir /mnt/etc
        configmount mount --root ~/etc /mnt/etc
        ```
        
        You should be able to navigate into the `/mnt/etc` directory and
        see the file `key` and the directory `another group`. Now you can change the configuration value of `key` like:
        
        ```
        cd /mnt/etc/config.yml
        echo new value >key
        ```
        
        The changes are written back into the file as soon as you unmount the directory `~/etc` from the mountpoint `/mnt/etc` via:
        
        ```
        fusermount -u /mnt/etc
        ```
        
        Finally `cat ~/etc/config.yml` should give you the modified file.
