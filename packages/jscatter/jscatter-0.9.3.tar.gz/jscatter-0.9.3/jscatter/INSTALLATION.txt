Installation
============

Dependencies
------------
-  numpy, scipy  ->  Mandatory, automatically installed by pip
-  Pillow        ->  Mandatory, for reading of SAXS images, automatic install by pip
-  matplotlib    ->  Mandatory, for 3D plots and on Windows
-  Ipython       ->  Optional, for convenience as a powerful python shell
-  gfortran      ->  Optional, without some functions dont work or use a slower python version
-  xmgrace       ->  Optional, preferred plotting on Unix like (use matplotlib on Windows)

Installation of gfortran/xmgrace may need root privileges. Use "sudo" on Linux and MacOS if needed.

Pip installation/upgrade
------------------------
(use pip2 or pip3 if NOT your default Python should be used) ::

  sudo pip install jscatter

As user in home directory (pip default installation directory is in ~/.local/).
No sudo needed, only user privileges, you don't need the admin to install/update::

 pip install jscatter --user

from a local repository (development versions)::

  pip install jscatter --user --upgrade --pre --find-links /where/the/file/is/saved

  options
  --user       : Install in user directory (folder defined by PYTHONUSERBASE or the default ~/.local)
  --find-links : look in the given path for package links e.g development releases
  --upgrade    : to install upgrades also for dependencies
  --pre        : to install also development versions


Linux
-----
* Ubuntu, all Debian related  ::

   sudo apt-get install gfortran grace python-matplotlib  # or python3-matplotlib
   sudo pip install ipython
   sudo pip install jscatter

* CentOs, Suse, Fedora ... do same as above but with yum/zypper...

* Manjaro Linux (yaourt asks for permission as root or prepend sudo as above)  ::

   # install gfortran
   yaourt gcc-fortran
   # install xmgrace (only found in AUR), fonts are needed for the interface, fonts are loaded after restart
   yaourt xorg-fonts-75 xorg-fonts-100 grace-openmotif python-matplotlib
   # tk might be missing for tkinter as matplotlib backend
   sudo pacman -S tk
   pip install ipython
   pip install jscatter

* CONTIN in DLS module (Only if needed).

  See DLS module documentation for details how to get and compile the original fortran code.

MacOs
-----
Install Homebrew first as given on their web page (see `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_) ::

   # install XQuartz from homebrew or from the AppStore
   sudo brew cask install xquartz
   # install xmgrace and gfortran
   sudo brew install grace gfortran matplotlib
   # then use pip
   sudo pip install ipython
   sudo pip install jscatter


Windows
-------
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution>`_ is a python distribution as alternative
with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, Ipython preinstalled.
Need of sudo depends on how Anaconda was installed (root or user).
Maybe the matplotlib backend needs to be configured on Windows to work properly.

And there was more to adjust, when i stopped waisting my time.
In my testcase it was a pain, but test and examples work (no Xmgrace, no fortran).

I strongly advise to **use Linux in a VirtualMachine** as it is easier to install and use.
::

   # install jscatter on working anaconda environment
   pip install jscatter

Jupyter Notebook
----------------
Jscatter works on Jupyter Notebooks.

To install jscatter on a server Jupyter installation (Jscatter not preinstalled)
prepend this on your script
::

 import sys,site
 # install jscatter as user in the current Jupyter kernel
 !{sys.executable} -m pip install jscatter --user
 # append user install dir to path
 sys.path.append(site.USER_BASE)

There is some trouble with inline plots (which are not interactive and cannot be updated)
dependent on the installed backend. This is related to the used matplotlib backend.

Use this to get interactive plots inline. ::

 %matplotlib notebook

Then import Jscatter. ::

 import jscatter as js

 js.usempl(True)  # use matplotlib
 js.usempl(False) # default, use grace on your computer with xmgrace in external window.

If you work over http on a server (usual no display of Xwindows applications) use the same to
switch to matplotlib.

Testing
-------
You can test basic functionality of jscatter after installation::

   import jscatter as js
   js.test.doTest()
   #basic graphics and fitting
   js.examples.runExample('example_SinusoidalFitting.py')

The Example shows :
 - 3 sine fit plots with one sine
 - a fit plot with 5 sine curves fitted simultaneous
 - a simple plot with 5 points ( phase against Amplitude of the 5 sines)


During development::

 python setup.py test


Troubleshooting and tips
------------------------

If xmgrace is not found by jscatter the path to the executable may be not on your PATH variable.
Check this by calling xmgrace in a shell.
Change your PATH in your .bashrc by adding::

   export PATH=/path/to/xmgrace:$(PATH) )

To open .agr files by klicking add a new file association e.g. to KDE.
 In SystemSettings/FileAssociations add a new type xmgrace.
 Inside this add FilenamePatterns '*.agr' and similar.

   In 'ApplicationPreferenceOrder' add xmgrace and edit this new application :
    In General :  edit name to "xmgrace" (keep it).
    In Application : edit name to "xmgracefree" and command to "xmgrace -free".
    This will open files in free floating size format.
   In 'ApplicationPreferenceOrder' add again application xmgrace (no changes)
   The second opens files in fixed size format (no '-free').
