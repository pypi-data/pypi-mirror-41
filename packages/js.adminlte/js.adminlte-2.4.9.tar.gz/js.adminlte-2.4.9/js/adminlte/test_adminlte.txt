How to use?
===========

This should be setup before rendering a page. See `fanstatic`_ for more
information::

  >>> from fanstatic import init_needed
  >>> needed = init_needed(base_url='http://localhost')

You can import ``adminlte`` from ``js.adminlte`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.adminlte import adminlte_js
  >>> adminlte_js.need()

Included plugins are ``datepicker_js``, ``timepicker_js``, ``datetimepicker_js``, ``bootstrap_wysihtml5_js``,
 ``icheck_js``, ``pace_js``, ``slimscroll_js``.
 The plugins can be imported from ``js.adminlte``
