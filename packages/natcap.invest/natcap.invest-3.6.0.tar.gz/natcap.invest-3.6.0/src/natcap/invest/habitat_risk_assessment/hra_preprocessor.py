            that are stressors. (required)
        args['exposure_crits'] (list): list containing string names of exposure
            criteria (hab-stress) which should be applied to the exposure

    will be created in ``args['workspace_dir']``. It will contain habitats_dir,
    species_dir, stressors_dir, and criteria_dir.

    Throwing together a simple error checking function for all of the inputs

        line- An array containing a line of H-S overlap data. The format of a
            line would look like the following:

                CritName- This will be propogated by default by
                    HRA_Preprocessor. Since it's coming in as a string, we
                    shouldn't need to check anything.
                Rating- Can either be the explicit string 'SHAPE', which would
                    be placed automatically by HRA_Preprocessor, or a float.
                    ERROR: if string that isn't 'SHAPE'.
                Weight- Must be a float (or an int), but cannot be 0.
                    ERROR: if string, or anything not castable to float, or 0.
                DataQuality- Most be a float (or an int), but cannot be 0.
                    ERROR: if string, or anything not castable to float, or 0.
                Exp/Cons- Most be the string 'E' or 'C'.
