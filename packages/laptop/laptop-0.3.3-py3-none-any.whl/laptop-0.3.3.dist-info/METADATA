# Laptop

Command-line tools for the HP Spectre laptop and Fujitsu ScanSnap scanner (Linux only)

## Installation

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3 upower scrot
sudo pip3 install laptop
```

## Commands

### Battery

Check the status of the laptop battery (just percent remaining)

```
battery
```

### Scan

Scans a collection of pages on the Fujitsu scanner. Always scans black and white, 2-sided, and generates a PDF. When one document is finished, load another document and press the Enter key to scan it. Simply hit ctrl-C to quit the loop.

```
scan
```

### Touchpad

Turn the touchpad on.

```
touchpad on
```

Turn the touchpad off.

```
touchpad off
```

### Screenshot

Take an interactive (drag the cursor) screenshot, names it with the date and time, and drop it in the `.screenshot` directory in the user's home folder. Note the directory must already exist; we recommend making it a symlink to a frequently-used directory such as `Desktop`.

```
screenshot
```

Note that this command was designed to be assigned to a keyboard shortcut for a faster screenshot than the default one in Ubuntu.

### Copy

Copy the contents of a file into the clipboard

```
copy myfile.txt
```

### UnDeb

Unpack and install a .deb file

```
undeb myfile.deb
```

_Note that Copy and UnDeb are generically useful Linux simplifications, not specific to the HP Spectre laptop or the Fujitsu scanner._
