## Features

* Fancy interface ✨
* Simple & Easy to use 🚀
* **Fast as lightning** ⚡️
* **Efficient and Effective** 💪🏻
* Manage notes & tasks in multiple boards 🗒
* **Run item as command inside terminal (subprocess)** 💨
* Import boards from external JSON files & Export boards as JSON files
* **Save & Load historic states**
* **Undo multiple actions / changes**
* **Interactive mode for dynamic operations**
* **Autocomplete & Autosuggestions in interactive mode**
* **`Gzip` compressed storage** 📚

## How the storage works

The main storage is powered by `shelve`, a Python standard library, which provides a lightweight & persistent file-based database system.
Whereas the "buffer" (the one which allows you to undo previous actions), is powered by a `pickle` object.

What makes `noteboard` special is that, the storage is compressed to `gzip` when it is not being accessed.
This greatly reduces size of the file by more than 50%. 

## Installation

### from source

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AlphaXenon/noteboard.git
$ cd noteboard
$ [sudo] python3 setup.py install
```

### via PyPI

`pip3 install noteboard`

### Requirements

**Python 3.6 or above**

[colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) --> for stylizing interface

[prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit) [optional] --> for interactive mode prompts

## Usage

    move                [&] Move an item to another board
    rename              [~] Rename the name of the board
    undo                [^] Undo the last action
    import              [I] Import and load boards from JSON file
    export              [E] Export boards as a JSON file

Options:
    -h, --help          show this help message and exit
    --version           show program's version number and exit
    -st, --show-time    show boards with the added time of every items
    -i, --interactive   enter interactive mode
```

---

### View Boards

`board`

* `-st/--show-time` : show boards with the last modified time of each items
* `-i/--interactive` : enter [interactive mode](#interactive-mode)

---

### Add Item

`board add <item text>`

* `-b/--board <name>` : add the item to this board

If no board `name` is specified, the item will be added to the default board.

---

### Remove Item

`board remove <item id> [<item id> ...]`

---

### Clear Board

Remove all items in the board.

`board clear [<name> [<name> ...]]`

If no board `name` is specified, all boards will be cleared.

---

### Tick / Mark / Star Item

`board {tick, mark, star} <item id> [<item id> ...]`

Run this command again on the same item to untick/unmark/unstar the item.

---

### Edit Item

`board edit <item id> <new text>`

---

### Tag Item

`board tag <item id> [<item id> ...]`

* `-t/--text <tag text>` : tag the item with this text
* `-c/--color <background color>` : set the background color `colorama.Back` of this tag (default: BLUE)

If no `text` is given, existing tag of this item will be removed.

---

### Move Item

`board move <item id> [<item id> ...] <name>`

---

### Rename Board

`board rename <name> <new name>`

---

### Run Item as Command

`board run <item id>`

This will spawn a subprocess to execute the command.

*NOTE: Some commands may not work properly in subprocess, such as pipes.*

**TODO:** Execute command in a peseudo terminal.

---

### Undo Previous Actions

`board undo`

#### Actions that can be undone:

* add
* remove
* clear
* edit
* import

---

### Import Boards from External JSON File

`board import <path>`

*NOTE:* This will overwrite all the current data of boards.

The JSON file must be in a valid structure simillar to the following.

```json
{
    "Board Name": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "data": "item text",
            "time": "<timestamp>",
            "date": "<human readable date format>",
            "tick": false,
            "mark": false,
            "star": false,
            "tag": "<tag text with ANSI code (auto manipulated by noteboard)>"
        }
    ]
}
```

---

### Export Boards Data as JSON File

`board export`

* `-d/--dest <destination path>` : destination path of the exported file (directory)

The exported JSON file is named `board.json`.

---

## Interactive Mode

**➤ Made with [python-prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit)**

Use `board -i/--interactive` to enter interactive mode.

**Commands:**

1. add
2. remove
3. clear
4. edit
5. undo
6. import
7. quit

Enter an empty line to view boards. Enter an empty line in prompt to abort operation.

*NOTE: You can use quotations (`'` or `"`) to specify multiple board names or board names that contain spaces and item ids.*

## Configurations

**Path:** *~/.config/noteboard/config.json*

### Default Configurations
```json
{
    "StoragePath": "~/.noteboard/",
    "DefaultBoardName": "Board"
}
```
* `StoragePath` : path to the custom storage path (where the data and log file are stored)
* `DefaultBoardName` : default board name, is used when no board is specified when adding item with `add` action

## Cautions

Some terminal emulators may not support dimmed (`Style.DIM`) & underlined (`\033[4m`) text.

The program also uses symbols such as `⭑` and `✔` which also may not be displayed properly in some terminal emulators and Windows cmd.

### Tested On:

**Shells:** bash, zsh

**Terminal Emulators:** iTerm2
