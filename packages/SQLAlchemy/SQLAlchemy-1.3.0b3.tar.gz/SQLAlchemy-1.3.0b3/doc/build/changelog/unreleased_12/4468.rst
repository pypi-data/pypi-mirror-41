    Fixed a regression in 1.2 where a wildcard/load_only loader option would
    not work correctly against a loader path where of_type() were used to limit
    to a particular subclass.  The fix only works for of_type() of a simple
    subclass so far, not a with_polymorphic entity which will be addressed in a
    separate issue; it is unlikely this latter case was working previously.
