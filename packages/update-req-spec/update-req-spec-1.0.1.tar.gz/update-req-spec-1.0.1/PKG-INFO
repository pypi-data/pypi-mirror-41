Description: # update-req-spec
        
        Update Python requirements in a setup.py file to permit latest available versions.
        
        ## Motivation
        
        You wish to cap the versions of the dependencies in your library to the major versions
        that are currently released since you have tested your library against these versions and, given
        everyone follows semantic versioning, minor updates should remain compatible. But keeping these
        version ranges up to date with new major releases can be tedious.
        
        `update-req-spec` makes this a little easier by updating the `install_requirements` in your
        `setup.py` so that the version specifications allow the latest major releases while retaining the
        minimum permitted versions. Then all you need to do is run your tests and publish a new release.
        
        For example, given:
        
        ```python
        from setuptools import setup
        
        setup(
            # --- snip ---
            install_requires=[
                "requests",
                "Click>=6.1",
                "attrs~=18.1",
            ],
            # --- snip ---
        )
        ```
        
        will be transformed to:
        
        ```python
        from setuptools import setup
        
        setup(
            # --- snip ---
            install_requires=[
                "requests<3",
                "Click>=6.1,<8",
                "attrs>=18.1,<19",
            ],
            # --- snip ---
        )
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install update-req-spec
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        update-req-spec setup.py
        ```
        
        If you use a private packge repository:
        
        ```
        update-req-spec --index-url http://private-repo.example/ setup.py
        
        # or
        
        export PIP_INDEX_URL=http://private-repo.example/
        update-req-spec setup.py
        ```
