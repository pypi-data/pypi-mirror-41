# **pythonloc**: Drop-in Python replacement that runs packages from local directory

**pythonloc** is a drop in replacement for python that automatically recognizes a `__pypackages__` directory and prefers importing packages installed in this location over user or global site-packages. If you are familiar with node, it is similar to `node_modules`.

It helps to manage and deploy isolated, reproducible environments. Isolating package installations avoids version conflicts.

This will avoid the steps to create, activate or deactivate "virtual environments", including tools relying on virtual environments such as pipenv or poetry. Python will use the `__pypackages__` from the base directory of the script when present.

This is an alternate pure Python implementation of [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/). The goal of pythonloc is to make an accessible tool while discussion takes place around adding this functionality to CPython itself. If you prefer, you can [build your own CPython](https://github.com/kushaldas/cpython/tree/pypackages) with these changes instead of using `pythonloc`.

## Installation: What's in the box?

### System Requirements
* Python 2.7+ installed
* pip installed

After installing with
```
python3 -m pip install --user pythonloc
```
you will have two CLI tools available to you: **pythonloc** and **piploc**

### pythonloc
Short for "python local", it is a drop-in replacement for python with one important difference: the local directory `__pypackages__` is added to the front of `sys.path`.

### piploc
Short for "pip local", it invokes pip with the same `sys.path` as `pythonloc`. If installing a package, the target installation directory is modified to be `__pypackages__` instead of the global `site-packages`.

If `__pypackages__` directory does not exist it will be created.

## Examples

### Script

`myapp.py`:
```python
import requests
print(requests)
```

```bash
> piploc install requests
Installing collected packages: urllib3, certifi, chardet, idna, requests
Successfully installed certifi-2018.11.29 chardet-3.0.4 idna-2.8 requests-2.21.0 urllib3-1.24.1

> pythonloc myapp.py  # works!
```

### CLI

You can run any python command with pythonloc and it will just run python under the hood:
```bash
> pythonloc --help
> pythonloc --version
```

Another example showing how imports work:
```bash
> ls

> pythonloc -c "import requests; print(requests)"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

> piploc install requests  # installs to __pypackages__
Installing collected packages: urllib3, certifi, chardet, idna, requests
Successfully installed certifi-2018.11.29 chardet-3.0.4 idna-2.8 requests-2.21.0 urllib3-1.24.1

> pythonloc -c "import requests; print(requests)"  # requests is now found
<module 'requests' from '/tmp/demo/__pypackages__/requests/__init__.py'>
```


## FAQ

### How is this different from a virtual environment?
* A virtual environment may or may not include system packages, whereas `pythonloc` will first look for packages in `__pypackages__`, then in other locations such as user or site-packages.
* `pythonloc` does not require activation or deactivation
* `pythonloc` only looks for a local directory called `__pypackages__`. On the other hand, virtual environment activation modifies your `PATH` so you can access virtual environment packages no matter which directory you're in.

### How does it work?
It's quite simple and clocks in at less than lines of 50 code. It uses features already built into Python and pip.

All it does is provide a slight level of indirection when invoking Python and pip. It modifies the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable when running Python to include `__pypackages__`.

> PYTHONPATH is a ':'-separated list of directories prefixed to the default module search path.  The result is sys.path.

pythonloc is an alias for `PYTHONPATH=__pypackages__:$PYTHONPATH python PYTHONARGS`

To install packages to the `__pypackages__` directory, it uses pip and runs

```bash
PYTHONPATH=__pypackages__:$PYTHONPATH python -m pip PIPARGS
```
where `PIPARGS` are whatever arguments you pass it, such as `piploc install requests`.

It will insert the arguments `--target __pypackages__` if you are installing a package.

### What actually gets put in `__pypackages__`?
The installed packages go there. This includes their source code, for example the `requests` directory below. metadata about the package is stored in the `*.dist-info` directories.

If you want to modify or debug the source of an installed package, it's very easy to do so. Just open the appropriate file in `__pypackages__` and edit away!
```bash
> piploc install requests
Installing collected packages: urllib3, certifi, chardet, idna, requests
Successfully installed certifi-2018.11.29 chardet-3.0.4 idna-2.8 requests-2.21.0 urllib3-1.24.1


> ls  # note __pypackages__ was created
__pypackages__

> ls __pypackages__/
bin                           idna-2.8.dist-info
certifi                       requests
certifi-2018.11.29.dist-info  requests-2.21.0.dist-info
chardet                       urllib3
chardet-3.0.4.dist-info       urllib3-1.24.1.dist-info
idna
```
### How do I uninstall packages from `__pypackages__`?
`piploc` will automatically add `__pypackages__` to `$PYTHONPATH`, so

```
piploc uninstall PACKAGE
```

will work.

If you get the error

> Not uninstalling PACKAGE at ..., outside environment ...

then run `deactivate` to make sure you are not using a virtual environment, then try again.

### requirements.txt?
You can use a requirements.txt file like so
```
piploc install -r requirements.txt
```

### poetry.lock?
pip cannot read poetry.lock files, so you'll have to generate a requirements.txt file.
```
poetry run pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

There may be an `export` command coming to `poetry` but it hasn't landed yet. See https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/pull/675.

### Pipfile/Pipfile.lock?
pip cannot read `Pipfile`s yet, only pipenv can. So you will need to generate requirements.txt using pipenv.
```
pipenv lock --requirements
pipenv lock --requirements --dev
```

### Can I make `python` do this instead of calling `pythonloc`?
An easy way to get this behavior is to create a symlink in your local directory
```
ln -s `which pythonloc` python
ln -s `which piploc` pip
```
Then run them with
```
./python
./pip
```
Otherwise you'll have to build CPython yourself with the [reference implementation](https://github.com/kushaldas/cpython/tree/pypackages) on GitHub.

### Why not use the reference implementation of PEP 582?
There is more overhead involved in building and distributing a custom CPython build than installing a pip package.

You are encouraged to check it out if you are interested though, it's pretty cool!

If it gets accepted and added to CPython then `pythonloc` may not be needed anymore.
