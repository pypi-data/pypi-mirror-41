**Command line interface to collect distant data and do something about it**

Install and usage
-----------------

::

  $ pip install lowatt_collect

Once your sources file is written (see section below), start collect by running ::

  lowatt-collect collect sources.yml

Our run postcollect on all previously collected files::

  lowatt-collect postcollect sources.yml

or on specified files only::

  lowatt-collect postcollect sources.yml data/sources/*.csv

Type::

  lowatt-collect --help
  lowatt-collect <command> --help

for all available options.


Collect sources definition
--------------------------

This is driven by a 'sources' definition YAML_ file. Each source may either
define sub-sources or have a 'collect' value indicating the command to use to
collect data and/or a 'postcollect' value indicating the command or commands to
start when a new file is collected.

One source may only have 'postcollect' defined without any 'collect' in case
where files are put in there by hand.

Last but not least, each collect is done within a temporary directory. Collected
files are moved from this directory to the sources hierarchy once fully
collected (e.g. downloaded) and all postcollect treatments occured (e.g. data is
imported in a database). If some error occurs for a file during postcollect,
it's moved in the 'errors' subdirectory of the source directory.

.. _YAML: http://yaml.org/

Below a sample source file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    root: /data/
    environment:
      CONFIG_DIR: /conf

    sources:

      meteofrance:
        collect: "python -m meteofrance -o {DIR}"
        postcollect: "python -m dataimport meteofrance"

      conso:

        bill:
          collect: "python -m conso dl-bill -I {ROOT}/index.json -o {DIR} {CONFIG_DIR}/conso.yml"
          postcollect:
          - "python -m dataimport conso bill"
          - "python -m billimport"

        index:
          collect: "python -m conso dl-index -o {DIR} {CONFIG_DIR}/conso.yml"
          postcollect: "python -m dataimport conso index"

      be:
        collect:
        postcollect: "python -m dataimport be"


Sources hierarchy will be mirrored under the directory specified as `root` value. The
above example would be mapped to:

.. code-block:: text

  /data
    /be
      <files put there by hand and importable by des.suez.read_xls_stream>
    /meteofrance
      <files collected from meteofrance and importable by des.mf.read_csv_stream>
    /conso
      /bill
        <files collected from tsme and importable by des.suez.read_pdf_stream>
      /index
        <files collected from tsme and importable by des.suez.read_xls_stream>



Commands are not shell command, yet you may expand environment variables using
brackets "{ENV_VAR}". Since command are splitted to be given to `exec`,
environment variables are the way to go to insert argument values containing
spaces::

    environment:
      CONFIG_DIR: /conf/directory with spaces/

    sources
      meteofrance:
        collect: "python -m meteofrance -c {CONFIG_DIR}"

Available environment variables are:

* those inherited from the process that launched the collect or postcollect

* those defined in the 'environment' section of the configuration file

* 'SOURCE': root source key from which the command is coming

* 'COLLECTOR': path from root to the collector joined by '.' - same as 'SOURCE'
  if the collector is defined at the first level in the hierarchy

* 'ROOT': path to the root directory

* 'DIR': source directory - this may not be the actual directory under 'ROOT'
  but a temporary directory, as collect happen within a temporary directory
  whose content is moved once collect and postcollect are done

* 'LOG_LEVEL' = the log level name received as argument ('DEBUG', 'INFO',
  'WARNING' or 'ERROR')

When run after `collect`, `postcollect` commands will be called for each
collected file, with its path as argument.

When run standalone, each `postcollect` command for a source will be called
once, either with all files specified as argument or with all files found in the
source directory.
