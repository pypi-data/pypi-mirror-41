NOTE TO TRASLATORS:

To start a new translation, create twice new folders (for example 'de_DE' for 
the German language and 'LC_MESSAGES') with the following tree:

    /locale
        /de_DE
            /LC_MESSAGES
            
Copy the file with the ".pot" extension, located in the source '/local' folder, 
and paste into the 'LC_MESSAGES' folder, renaming the extension to ".po". 
Now you can work on new tanslation with a translation editing program (for 
example 'poedit') and then save it by generating a '.mo' file.

Than update the "videomass2/vdms_SYS/app_const.py" file by adding the newly 
translated language to the dictionary, for example add this line:

    u "de": wx.LANGUAGE_GERMAN,
    
to:

    supLang = {u "en": wx.LANGUAGE_ENGLISH,
               u "it": wx.LANGUAGE_ENGLISH,
               u "de": wx.LANGUAGE_GERMAN,
               }
