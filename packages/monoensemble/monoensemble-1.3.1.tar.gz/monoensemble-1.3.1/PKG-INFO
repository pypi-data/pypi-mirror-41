Description: 
        
        monoensemble
        ========
        This package contains high performance implementations of 
        MonoGradientBoostingClassifier and MonoRandomForestClassifier. These monotone
        classifiers use the fast and scaleable monotone rule approach described
        in Bartley C., Liu W., and Reynolds M. \Enhanced Random Forest Algorithms for
        Partially Monotone Ordinal Classication". In: Proceedings of the Thirty-Third AAAI Conference on
        Articial Intelligence (AAAI-2019), Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, Jan 27 - Feb 1 PREPRESS. ed. by
        AAAI Press. AAAI. 2019.
