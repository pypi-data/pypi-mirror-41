Python functions for working with D-ary Heap (Heap with more than 2 child nodes). For more info about this Data Structure Please gothrough: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-ary_heap

This library provides the below Heap specific functions.

*heapify*
	Convert list of elements to Heap data structure (MinHeap/MaxHeap)

*add_element*
	Add single/list of elements to Heap

*get_root_value*
	Returns root value of the Heap without removing the element
	Minimum value for Min Heap, Maximum value for Max Heap

*extract_root*
	Extract root element from Heap and reform the Heap

*search_value*
	Searches the value in heap and returns index.
	if same element is present multiple times, first occurring index is returned

*delete_element_at_index*
	Remove the element at the specified index and reform the Heap


For example function invocations, plesae see the tutorial.
