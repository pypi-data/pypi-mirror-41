Description: # What is dynamic-preferences-plus ?
        
        Dynamic-preferences-plus is a Django app designed to manage your project settings. While most of the time,
        a `settings.py` file is sufficient, there are some situations where you need something more flexible,
        such as per-user settings and per-site settings.
        
        For per-user settings, you could actually store them in `UserProfile`. However, it means that every time you want to add a new setting, you need to add a new column to the `UserProfile` DB table. Not very efficient.
        
        Dynamic-preferences-plus allow you to register settings (a.k.a. preferences) in a declarative way, for users,
        sites and your whole project. Preferences values are serialized before storage in database,
        and automatically deserialized when you want to access them.
        
        With dynamic-preferences-plus, you can update settings on the fly, through django's admin or custom forms, without restarting your application.
