## NMLU - Nano Machine Learning Utilities toolkit

**W.I.P.**

Set of ultra-lightweight utility functions for miscellaneous data-science and machine-learning work.

Inspired by stuff from [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) library/framework, but intended to be easier to understand (has typings, occasionally better comments, more readable code with meaningful variable names and PEP8-compliant etc.).

_Anyway, all this is quite hacky, unfinished, and probably not usable for anyone else but myself :worried: ...but it might grow into something more serious._
