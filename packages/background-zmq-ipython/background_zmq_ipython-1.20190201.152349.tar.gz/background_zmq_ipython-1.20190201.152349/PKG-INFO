        * ``IPython.embed_kernel`` in a background thread
          (`example code <https://github.com/msabramo/pyramid_ipython_kernel/blob/master/pyramid_ipython_kernel.py>`_).
          This has some issues
          (e.g. `here <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/4032>`_;
          messing around with ``sys.stdout`` etc).
        * This code was introduced in
          `this StackOverflow question <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29148319/provide-remote-shell-for-python-script>`_,
          and also discussed in this `IPython GitHub issue #8097 <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/8097>`_,
          but it has become outdated, so this project provides a rewrite / updated code,
          and the goal was also an easy to install pip package.
