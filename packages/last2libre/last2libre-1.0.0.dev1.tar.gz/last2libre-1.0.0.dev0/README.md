Utility to export Last.fm / Libre.fm history and import history into Libre.fm / Gnu.fm


## About

last2libre is a utility to export and import scrobble / listen history from Last.fm and Gnu.fm sites (e.g. Libre.fm).
You can export history from Last.fm, Libre.fm, or a Gnu.fm instance to a text file.
After, you can import this data to Libre.fm or a Gnu.fm instance to replicate history between two different platforms.
These scripts make music listening history more accessible and also could enable study of a specific user's listening trends.


## Usage

Detailed usage instructions coming soon (updated documentation expected with v1.0.0 release).
