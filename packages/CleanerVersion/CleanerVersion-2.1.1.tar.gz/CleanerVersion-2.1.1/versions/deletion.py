class VersionedCollector(Collector):
    """
    A Collector that can be used to collect and delete Versionable objects.
    The delete operation for Versionable objects is Versionable._delete_at,
    which does not delete the record, it updates it's version_end_date to be
    the timestamp passed to the delete() method.

    Since non-versionable and versionable objects can be related, the delete()
    method handles both of them.  The standard Django behaviour is kept for
    non-versionable objects.  For versionable objects, no pre/post-delete
    signals are sent.  No signal is sent because the object is not being
    removed from the database.  If you want the standard signals to be sent,
    or custom signals, create a subclass of this class and override
    versionable_pre_delete() and/or versionable_post_delete(), and in your
    settings file specify the dotted path to your custom class as a
    string, e.g.:
    VERSIONED_DELETE_COLLECTOR_CLASS =
