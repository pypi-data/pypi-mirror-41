ðŸš¨ **This package is in the early stages of design and implementation.** ðŸš¨

All functions/classes/interfaces are subject to change as we experiment with new design
ideas and implement new features. **This is NOT a finished product.**

We welcome any feedback and ideas!

About
-----

PyGMT is a library for processing geospatial and geophysical data and making
publication quality maps and figures. It provides a Pythonic interface for the
`Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) <https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt>`__, a
command-line program widely used in the Earth Sciences.

We rely heavily on new features currently being implemented in GMT. In particular, a new
*modern execution mode* that greatly simplifies figure creation. **These features are
not available in the 5.4 version of GMT**. They will be part of the future 6.0 release
of GMT predicted for early 2019.


Project goals
-------------

* Make GMT more accessible to new users.
* Build a Pythonic API for GMT.
* Interface with the GMT C API directly using ctypes (no system calls).
* Support for rich display in the Jupyter notebook.
* Integration with the Scipy stack: numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame for data tables
  and xarray.DataArray for grids.


Contacting Us
-------------

* Most discussion happens `on Github

  open issue or pull request.
* We have a `chat room on Gitter <https://gitter.im/GenericMappingTools/pygmt>`__
  where you can ask questions and leave comments.

Imposter syndrome disclaimer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready
to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good enough to
contribute. What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equality important contributions include: writing or proof-reading documentation,
suggesting or implementing tests, or even giving feedback about the project (including
giving feedback about the contribution process). If you're coming to the project with
fresh eyes, you might see the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have
glossed over. If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
