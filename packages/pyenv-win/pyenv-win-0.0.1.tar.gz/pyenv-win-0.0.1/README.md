## Introduction

The [pyenv][1] is a great tool, but it doesn't supports windowns platform, which was the same case in [rbenv][2] for ruby developers. After a bit of research and feedbacks from python developer loves to have such a feature for windows systems.

Found a similar system for [rbenv-win][3] for ruby developers. This project was forked from [rbenv-win][3] and modified for [pyenv][1]. Some commands doesn't implemented, but wouldn't be a problem in basic use.

## pyenv

[pyenv][1] is a simple python version management tool. It lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.
