## Getting Started

First of all, you need an API key from [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). Once that's done, you can initialize the wrapper in one of two ways.

#### Initialize using Environment Variable
Set the environment variable ``D2_API_KEY`` to the API key you just generated, and then initialize your wrapper using,
```python
api = d2api.APIWrapper()
```
#### Initialize inline
You can also initialize the wrapper inline using,
```python
# This takes priority over the environment variable
api = d2api.APIWrapper(api_key = 'your api key')
```

You can find further use cases and examples [here](https://d2api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).
