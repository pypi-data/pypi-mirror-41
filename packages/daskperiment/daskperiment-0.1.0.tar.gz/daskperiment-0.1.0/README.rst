Overview
~~~~~~~~

A lightweight tool to perform reproducible machine learning experiment using Dask.

**The package is EXTREMELY unstable.**

Benefits
~~~~~~~~

- User-intuitive.

  - Minimizing modifications of existing codes.
  - Performing experiments using `Dask` compatible API.
  - Easily handle experiments history (with `pandas` basic operations).
  - Requires less work to manage with Git (no need to make branch per trials).
  
- Tracking experiment result and its (hyper) parameters.
- Tracking environment.

  - OS Info
  - Python version
  - Installed package and its version
  
- Tracking code context.
- Auto saving and loading previous experiment history.
- Parallel execution of experiment steps.

Future Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Web Dashboard
- Reproducibility check (function purity check).
- Sharing experiments.
- More efficient execution.

  - Omit execution if depending parameters are the same
  - Distributed execution
