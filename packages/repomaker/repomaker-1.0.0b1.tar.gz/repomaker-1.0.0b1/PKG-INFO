        # Installation
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Please make sure you have the following requirements installed
        before proceeding with the installation. 
        
        ### Install
        
        * `pip` for installation of Python 3 dependencies
        * `virtualenv` to create a isolated Python environment `apt install `
        * Python development and build files for installing/building some dependencies
        
        On Debian, you can simply run this:
        
        `apt install python3-pip python3-wheel python3-dev virtualenv build-essential`
        
        Currently, Repomaker only works with Python versions minor than 3.7 due to
        [a bug in Django](https://github.com/django/django/commit/931c60c5216bd71bc11f489e00e063331cf21f40).
        This means that you need to install older versions of Python, e.g. version 3.6,
        if you are on a bleeding edge distro like Arch Linux.
        If you try to get this running on Arch Linux,
        [this comment](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/repomaker/issues/197#note_114210540) might help.
        
        ### Runtime
        
        * `keytool` from Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
        * `apksigner` or alternatively jarsigner from Java Development Kit (JDK)
        * Android Asset Packaging Tool (`aapt`)
        * `libmagic` for mime-type detection
        * `rsync` to publish repositories
        * `git` to publish repositories to git mirrors
        
        On Debian, you can simply run this:
        
        `sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless apksigner aapt libmagic1 rsync git`
        
        ## Install into virtual environment
        
        To not mess with other Python libraries you have installed,
        we will install repomaker into its own isolated Python environment.
        
            virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 repomaker
            source repomaker/bin/activate
            pip install repomaker[gui]
        
        You should now be able to start by typing:
        
            repomaker
        
        If you want to work on repomaker,
        please see the development section below.
        
        ## Troubleshooting
        
        First check that you really have all dependencies from above installed.
        
        If the installation fails with something about `openssl`,
        try to install `libssl-dev` with `apt install libssl-dev`.
        
        If starting repomaker fail with the error ```Could not find `keytool` program.```,
        you might run into [this known issue](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/repomaker/issues/192).
        Try if `apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless` fixes it for you.
        
        If the graphical user interface fails to start,
        you can try running `repomaker-server` and `repomaker-tasks`.
        If that works, you should be able to open [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
        in your browser.
        
        # Development
        
        To work on repomaker, you need _npm_ to fetch CSS and JavaScript dependencies: `apt install npm`.
        
        Then run `npm install` to install these dependencies.
        
        If you want to run repomaker in your browser rather then using the GUI,
        you can start it like this:
        
            virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 repomaker
            source repomaker/bin/activate
            ./setup.sh
            ./run.sh
        
        ## Translation
        
        * GNU gettext `apt install gettext`
