        Esoterrible can be installed through Pip. Tested with CPython `3.6.5` and `3.7.1`
        
        ```
        pip install esoterrible
        ```
        
        [example_usage.py](https://github.com/rach-sharp/esoterrible/blob/master/example_usage.py)
        has examples of the horrible features included.
