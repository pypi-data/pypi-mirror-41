Getting started
===============
doxphinx is a theme for the Sphinx documentation system. The purpose of doxphinx
is to provide a single mechanism to generate the documentation of a project,
both in HTML and PDF formats, from a common source.

This common source of documentation consists of a set of text files written in
reStructuredText markup language along with a set of conventions for writing and
organizing the different files. The Sphinx tool can then be used to automatically
generate a HTML website or a PDF book, both from the same single documentation source.


How to use
==========
In order to use the doxphinx theme you need to install Sphinx in your system and
create a Sphinx documentation project. Then, you can install the doxphinx theme
in the documentation projectâs themes folder. Configure the conf.py file of the
project to point to the doxphinx theme and you are ready to generate the documentation.


Status
======
The doxphinx project is in DEVELOPMENT status. The internal structure of the theme
and the way of distributing releases may still change a lot.
