TODO: pypi version and pypi python version shields

NeuroneLoader is a python module for loading data recorded with
Bittium NeurOne (formerly MegaEMG).

Props to Andreas Henelius at Finnish Institute of Occupational Health for figuring out how
to read the NeurOne binary format in pure python as part of his
export2hdf_ project.

* `Quick start`_
* Documentation_

.. _Documentation: https://neurone-loader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
.. _export2hdf: https://github.com/bwrc/export2hdf5

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   pip install neurone_loader


.. _quick-start:

Quick start
-----------

.. code:: python

   >>> from neurone_loader import Recording
   >>> rec = Recording(path_to_recording_folder)
   >>> rec.event_codes
   array([  0,   1,  12,  13,  99, 128], dtype=int32)

Please note that because raw EEG recordings can be quite large this package is very memory aware. Most data will be loaded
from disk lazily, i.e. the moment you're actually accessing it, and redundant data will be removed from memory as soon
as it has been copied - unless you specify otherwise.

I recommend looking at the docstrings before executing anything and
maybe having a look at Concepts section in the Documentation_ before you start working with this package.

Contributing
------------

If you encounter any problem feel free to open a issue_ on GitHub. If you found a bug and want to
supply a fix or if you want to contribute a new feature open a `pull request`_. Just make sure that
your code is not breaking any tests and you also supply tests for your code.
