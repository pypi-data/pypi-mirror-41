External libraries
==================

`SDL2` and `SDL2_gfx` libraries should be placed in your operating system's usual location.
If that does not work, you can place a copy of the libraries in the subdirectory corresponding to your system:

- Windows (64 bit): `win32_x64\`  
- Windows (32 bit): `win32_x86\`  
- MacOS: `darwin/`
