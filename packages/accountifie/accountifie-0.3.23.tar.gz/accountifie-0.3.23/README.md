Thanks go to:

- [Andrew McKenzie](https://github.com/andrewpmckenzie) for the accountifie-svc and more
- [the folks at Reportlab](http://www.reportlab.com) especially [Andy Robinson](https://github.com/captainrobbo) who also contributed code from his personal DoubleTalk accounting package.
- [Electronifie](http://www.electronifie.com)

The whole project was developed at [Electronifie](http://www.electronifie.com) with significant work from [Reportlab](http://www.reportlab.com) including the contribution of parts of their docengine framework for hosted document generation. Reportlab's commercial pdf document generation library is not included but Electronifie does use it and it drops in very easily to the application for those with licenses.
