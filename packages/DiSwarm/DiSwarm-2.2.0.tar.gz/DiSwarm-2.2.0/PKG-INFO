Description: # DiSwarm
        Discord-based Swarm Protocol Library
        
        ## Usage
        Main class: `Swarm`
        
        Initialize like so:
        ```swarm = Swarm(discord channel id: str, discord bot token: str, swarm id: str)```
        
        Sending message to swarm:
        ```swarm.send(string message)```
        
        Getting messages from swarm:
        ```swarm.get_queue()```
        returns a list of ```(timestamp, decoded message)``` tuples from your swarm members
        
        ### Important:
        Before you end your program, call ```swarm.end()``` to cleanly end the discord bot process
        
        ## Notes
        - Swarm ID: the same for all bots in your swarm, but it should be unique from any other swarm, at least on your swarm channel. To be safe, use a randomly generated string or number. Make sure every bot in your swarm has the same id, because bots with different ids cannot see eachother's messages.
        - ```get_queue()``` will only return messages from your swarm, so you can have multiple swarms in the same channel.
        - DiSwarm uses Fernet encryption, provided by the `cryptography` library. Install this library through `pip install cryptography`.
        - Also requires `pip install discord`
