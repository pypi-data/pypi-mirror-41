Description: # block.bootstrap.pytorch
        
        In Machine Learning, an important question is "How to embed two modalities in a same space".
        For instance, in Visual Question Answering, one must embed the image and the question in a same bi-modal space which will be classified to provide the answer.

        We introduce a novel module (BLOCK) to fuse two representations together. First, we experimentaly demonstrate that it is better than any available fusion. Secondly, we provide a therotical-grounded analysis around the notion of tensor complexity. For further details, please see:

        In this repo, we make available all the fusions from the state-of-the-art via a nice pip install interface. Also, we provide pretrained models and all the code needed to reproduce our experiments. The available fusions are the following:
        
        - Block
        - Mutan
        - Tucker
        - MCB
        - MLB
        - MFB
        - MFH
        - MLP

        ## Install
        
        ### Requirements
        
        We don't provide support for python2. We advise you to install python3 with Anaconda. Then, you can create an environment.
        
        ```
        conda create --name block python=3
        source activate block
        ```
        
        We use Bootstrap.pytorch, a [high level framework](https://github.com/Cadene/bootstrap.pytorch) to focus on the model instead of boilerplate code.
        
        ```
        cd $HOME
        git clone https://github.com/Cadene/bootstrap.pytorch.git
        cd bootstrap.pytorch
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        git clone  --recursive https://github.com/Cadene/block.bootstrap.pytorch.git block
        pip install -r block/requirements.txt
        ```
