# PMIX: Questionnaire Language Utilities

A mixed bag of PMA2020 utilities. There are several functionalities all based
on working with spreadsheets. The main features are the following:

* [Analytics](#analytics)
* [Borrow](#borrow)
* [Cascade](#cascade)
* [Numbering](#numbering)
* [PPP](#ppp)
* [Workbook](#workbook)
* [XlsDiff](#xlsdiff)
* [Viffer](#viffer)

Formerly [`qlang`](https://github.com/jkpr/qlang), this package has been renamed and expanded to provide new
functionality and new command-line tools. The command line tools are described after installation.

This version requires Python 3 or later. Python 2 is not supported.


## Installation

This package is on PyPI! Run:

```
python3 -m pip install pmix
```

For developers, to install from Github, run:

```
python3 -m pip install https://github.com/PMA-2020/pmix/zipball/master
```

## Analytics

Usage

```
python3 -m pmix.analytics FILE1 [FILE2 ...]
```

creates a JSON file describing the prompts and fields for analytics.

## Borrow
The purpose of the Pmix *Borrow* module use to assist with translation
management of ODK forms. It is especially useful for merging translations from
one file into another.

#### Command Line Usage
This module is called with

```
python3 -m pmix.borrow
```

and it does two things. Without the `-m` argument, it simply creates a
translation dictionary. The source string is in the first column, and the
target languages are in the subsequent columns. With the `-m` argument,
it creates a translation dictionary and then merges those translations into
the file specified by `-m`.

##### Examples

1) Without `-m`,

```
python3 -m pmix.borrow FILE1 [FILE2 ...]
```

creates a translation dictionary from `FILE1 [FILE2 ...]`.

2) With `-m`,

```
python3 -m pmix.borrow -m TARGET FILE1 [FILE2 ...]
```

creates a translation dictionary from `FILE1 [FILE2 ...]` and then merges into `TARGET`.

In both examples, a default output filename is used, but one can be specified with the `-o` argument.

#### The Input File
The input file can be 1 of 2 kinds:
1. A standard ODK file.
2. A raw translations file.

A raw translations file has the following form, using English and French as
examples:

| text::English | text::Fran√ßais | ... | text::<language *n*\> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hello! | Bonjour! | ... | <"Hello!" in language *n*\> |

#### Diverse translations

There are a set of command-line options to work with diverse translations.

- `-D` This option, used without argument, means if text has diverse translations, do not borrow it. Only has effect with `-m`
- `-C CORRECT` This option marks a file as correct. Fill in `CORRECT` with a path to a source file. Its translations are given precedence over others. If there is only one input file, and it is correct, then there is no need to mark it correct because nothing can override it.
- `d DIVERSE` Give a language found in the forms for `DIVERSE`. This option is used without `-m`. It creates a file with only strings that have diverse translations in the supplied language from the source files.

---

#### The Output File
A resultant file with merged translations has the following possible highlighting:

- ![#ffd3b6](https://placehold.it/15/ffd3b6/000000?text=+) *Orange* if the source and the translation are the same.
- ![#9acedf](https://placehold.it/15/9acedf/000000?text=+) *Blue* if the new translation changes the old translation.
- ![#d3d3d3](https://placehold.it/15/d3d3d3/000000?text=+) *Grey* if the new translation fills in a previously missing translation (blank cell).
- ![#85ca5d](https://placehold.it/15/85ca5d/000000?text=+) *Green* if the translation is not found in the TranslationDict, but there is a pre-existing translation.
- ![#ffaaa5](https://placehold.it/15/ffaaa5/000000?text=+) *Red* if translation is not found and there is no pre-existing translation.
- ![#fffa81](https://placehold.it/15/fffa81/000000?text=+) *Yellow* if using the `-D` option, shows strings that have diverse translations without inserting them.
- ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) *No highlight* if the translation is the same as the pre-existing translation.

## Cascade

Usage

```
python3 -m pmix.cascade FILE
```

creates a new Excel spreadsheet after converting geographic identifiers from wide format to tall format.

## Numbering

Use the numbering mini-language and create question numbers for an ODK survey.

```
python3 -m pmix.numbering FILE
```

The program then looks for a column entitled "N" in the "survey" worksheet. It creates numbers based off of the
directives there and adds them to label columns.

## Workbook

There following features are offered:

1. Convert a worksheet to CSV with UTF-8 encoding and UNIX-style newlines.

```
python3 -m pmix.workbook FILE -c SHEET
```

2. Remove all trailing and leading whitespace from all text cells

```
python3 -m pmix.workbook FILE -w
```

## XlsDiff
A utility for showing the differences between two Excel files.

```
python3 -m pmix.xlsdiff FILE1 FILE2 --excel
```

The above command creates a new Excel file, creating a new version of `FILE2` 
with highlighting to show differences.

![#ff0000](https://placehold.it/15/ff0000/000000?text=+) *Red* -- Rows and columns that are duplicate so are not compared  
![#FFD3B9](https://placehold.it/15/FFD3B9/000000?text=+) *Orange/Peach* -- Rows and columns that are in the marked up file (`FILE2`), but not in the other  
![#FFF78E](https://placehold.it/15/FFF78E/000000?text=+) *Light Yellow* -- Cells that are different between the the two files  
![#00ff00](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) *Green* -- Rows that are in a changed order

##### Options
| Short Flag | Long Flag | Description |
|:-----------|:----------|:------------|
| -h | --help | Show this help message and exit. |
| -r | --reverse | Reverse the order of the base file and the new file for processing. |
| -s | --simple | Do a simple diff instead of the default ODK diff. |
| -e | --excel | Path to write Excel output. If flag is given with no argument then default out path is used. If flag is omitted, then write text output to STDOUT.|

## Viffer
Viffer is a tool that provides a tabulated report on the differences between two XlsForms. Viffer stands for "Version Diff'er".

This tool is currently under development under another fork of pmix. If interested in using it, please see: https://github.com/joeflack4/pmix/tree/feature_viffer#viffer

##### Example Usage
Generate a Viffer report.
`python -m  pmix.viffer old_form.xlsx new_form.xlsx`
