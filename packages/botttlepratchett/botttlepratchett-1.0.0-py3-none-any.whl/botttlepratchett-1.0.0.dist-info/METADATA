# bottlepratchett

A very simple middleware that provides GNU Terry Pratchett.

---

In one of Terry Pratchett's novels, he proposes three things, that following his death, so more technically inclined fans have grabbed onto.

1. The clacks
2. The GNU instruction to the clacks (G: Send message on, N: Do not log the message, U: At the end of the line, send the message back again)
3. "A man is not dead while his name is still spoken."

So, in that friendly spirit...

A header, applied to all connections, ('X-Clacks-Overhead': 'GNU Terry Pratchett'), so that he may never be forgotten.

---

This plugin designed for Bottle gives you just that.

```
import bottle
import bottlepratchett

bottle.install(bottlepratchett.wrap)

@bottle.get('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello'

bottle.run()
```

Once you've installed the plugin with ```bottle.install``` it should become available on every new call to your route. (Bottle plugins are installed on the first call per route, and then cached.)

So... If we were to use curl, we could get:

```
> curl -I localhost:8080
HTTP/1.0 200 OK

Our header has been successfully installed.
