Description: # gokinjo
        
        - A feature extraction library based on k-nearest neighbor algorithm in Python
          - k-NN based feature has experience of being used in 1st place solution of Kaggle competition
        - Switchable backend of k-NN algorithm
          - [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) (default)
          - [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)
        - FYI: 'gokinjo' is meant neighborhood in japanese.
