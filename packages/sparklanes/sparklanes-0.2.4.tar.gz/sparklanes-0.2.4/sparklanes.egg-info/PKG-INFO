Description: sparklanes is a lightweight data processing framework for Apache Sparkwritten in Python. It was built with the intention to make buildingcomplex spark processing pipelines simpler, by shifting the focustowards writing data processing code without having to spent much timeon the surrounding application architecture.
        Data processing pipelines, or *lanes*, are built by stringing togetherencapsulated processor classes, which allows creation of lane definitionswith an arbitrary processor order, where processors can be easilyremoved, added or swapped.
        Processing pipelines can be defined using *lane configuration YAML files*,to then be packaged and submitted to spark using a single command.Alternatively, the same can be achieved manually by using the frameworkAPI.
