        Introduction
        ============
        This tool allows Plone managers to auto-discover and fix subject keywords,
        location and temporal coverage using http://www.alchemyapi.com/ web service.
        
        
        Main features
        =============
        
        - Auto-discover keywords, locations and temporal coverage;
        - Auto highlight keywords within a page content based on selected
          tags and link them to a custom search page;
        - Auto update related items based on internal links found within
          object's metadata.
        
        
        Planed features
        ===============
        
        - Add a wizard icon near Subject, Location, etc fields in edit form
          to auto-discover and suggest tags based on text in
          other fields (Title, Description)
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        - Add eea.alchemy to your eggs section in your buildout and re-run buildout. You
          can download a sample buildout from
          https://github.com/collective/eea.alchemy/tree/master/buildouts/plone4
        - Install eea.alchemy within Site Setup > Add-ons
        
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        Auto discover keywords, location, related items or temporal coverage
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        1. Get your alchemy key here: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html
        2. Update your alchemy API key within Site Setup > Alchemy Settings
        3. Within Plone Control panel go to Alchemy Discoverer.
        
        Auto tagging
        ------------
        
        1. *Enable auto-tagging* within **Site Setup > Alchemy Settings**
        2. Edit your document and add some tags for it within **/edit > Categorization.**
           For example, if you're writing a news article about *water pollution* go to
           **/edit > Categorization** and add *water pollution* within tags field
           (also known as *keywords*, *subjects*, *topics*).
           Now when you navigate to the **View** page of this article,
           you'll notice that all occurrences of *water pollution* within your news
           article body are links to a custom search page which is also configurable
           within **Alchemy Settings ControlPanel**
        
        Auto relations
        --------------
        1. *Enable auto-relations* within **Site Setup > Alchemy Settings**
        2. Edit your document and add some internal links for it
           within **/edit > Body Text.**
           For example, if you're writing an article about an event add a internal link
           to this event within **Body Text** field.
           Now Save your article and you should see a notification message on top of
           the page saying something like: **Automatically detected and added
           one relation since it is linked in content.**
           If you check the related content section for your article you'll notice that
           the Event object was automatically added there.
