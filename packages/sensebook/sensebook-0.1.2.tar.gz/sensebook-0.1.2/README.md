This project attempts to document Facebooks undocumented API, so that libraries
can interact with Facebook in the same way the browser does. The main focus is
Facebooks Messenger, and enabling users to send and recieve messages.

The documentation mostly exists in the form of a
[Sans-IO](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) Python implementation, so this
project on its own isn't useful to the vast majorty, if you just want a plug n'
play library, see [fbchat](https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat).

Note: This project is not affiliated with Facebook, Inc. or any of that stuff,
and I'll have to comply if I recieve a takedown notice.
