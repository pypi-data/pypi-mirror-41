OpenAI gym Embedding world

Two word embedding mapping compatible with OpenAI gym.

Requirements:
        - Python 3.5+
        - OpenAI Gym
        - NumPy
        - Gensim

Install environment on anaconda

-    $ conda env create -f gym-embedding-world/environment.yml
-    $ source embedding-world
-    $ pip install -e gym-embedding-world/.


Install environment on colab

-    !git clone "https://github.com/SamirMoustafa/gym-embedding-world.git"
-    !pip install -e gym-embedding-world/.
-    !mv gym-embedding-world gym-embedding-world-org
-    !cp -r gym-embedding-world-org/embedding_world /content
-    !ls embedding_world


Usage

-   $ python >>> import gym
-   $ python >>> import embedding_world
-   $ python >>> env = gym.make('embedding_world-v0')
-   $ python >>> env.set_paths(embedding_from_file="... YOUR EMBEDDING PATH TO MAP FROM IT  ...",
-                             embedding_to_file  ="... YOUR EMBEDDING PATH TO MAP TO IT  .....")
-   $ python >>> env.production_is_off()
-   $ python >>> env.set_sentences('... YOUR SENTENCE TO TRANSLATE FROM IT ...',
-                                 '... YOUR SENTENCE TO TRANSLATE TO IT .....')
-   $ python >>> state, reward, done, info = env.step('dim(0)+1')

Embedding world is a simple environment based on OpenAI gym, that loads two-word embedding e.g. Stanfrod GloVe or facebook fastText models with N-dimension and moves from one word(s) embedding-location to the other embedding using an agent actions such that actions that could be taken are 2N + 1 actions {dimension(i)+1, dimension(i)-1} ∪  {pickup} ∀ i in range from 1 to N

which deterministically cause the corresponding state transitions
but actions that would take an agent of the grid leave a state unchanged.
The reward is negative for all transition until the goal is reached.
The terminal state(goal) is represented in a vector/s.

This environment has been built as part of a graduation project at [University of Alexandria, Department of Computer Science](http://sci.alexu.edu.eg/index.php/en/)
