        ## Development Environment
        
        ### Setup
        Follow these steps to create a development environment for Zinc:
        
            cd ~/projects
            git clone git@github.com:blinkdog/zn.git
            cd zn
            python3.7 -m venv ./env
            source env/bin/activate
            pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        ### Maintenance
        If you install a new package using `pip install` then update the
        `requirements.txt` file with the following command:
        
            pip freeze --all >requirements.txt
        
        ### Working
        The helper script `snake` defines some common project tasks:
        
            Try one of the following tasks:
        
            snake clean                # Remove build cruft
            snake coverage             # Perform coverage analysis
            snake dist                 # Create a distribution tarball and wheel
            snake lint                 # Run static analysis tools
            snake publish              # Publish the module to Test PyPI
            snake rebuild              # Test and lint the module
            snake test                 # Test the module
        
        The task `rebuild` doesn't really build (no need to compile Python),
        but it does run the unit tests and lint the project.
        
        #### Version Bumping
        If you need to increase the version number of the project, don't
        forget to edit the following:
        
            CHANGELOG.md
            setup.py
