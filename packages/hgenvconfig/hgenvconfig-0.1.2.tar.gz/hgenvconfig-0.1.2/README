environment config
==================

This extension is a utility to pass ``--config`` options via the ``HGCONFIG``
environment variable. The use-case is for servers that need to set this once
then pass it around to child processes (e.g. hooks) and other helpers that
don't necessarily invoke ``hg`` via the command-line.

install
-------

Enable envconfig like any mercurial extension: download the source code to a
local directory, and add that directory to your ``.hgrc``:

Example config::

  [extensions]
  envconfig = path/to/hgenvconfig/hgext
