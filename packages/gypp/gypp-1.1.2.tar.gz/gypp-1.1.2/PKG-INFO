Description: gypp - readonly access to GPG YAML files
        ========================================
        
        ``gypp`` provides convenience methods for accessing entries in a GPG encrypted YAML file.
        
        The YAML file has a structure like::
        
            # Comments start with a "#"
            DESCRIPTION: |
              This is a human readable description of this file.
        
            RECIPIENTS:
              - list of
              - recipients of
              - the encrypted file
        
            some_key:
              user: name of account (required)
              password: the password or phrase (required)
              name: human readable name of entry (optional)
              note: |
                optional note. The pipe char indicates that
                line breaks will be preserved, but the
                preceding space on each line will not.
              other: Other properties may be added as needed.
        
            another_key:
              user: some user
              password: password with a quote " in it
              name: another test entry
              note: |
                Same old stuff
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
          pip install -U gypp
        
        
        Use
        ---
        
        List entries available::
        
          $ gypp my_passwords.gpg
        
          Source: junk.txt
          Description: This is a human readable description of this file.
        
          Keys available:
            some_key          : human readable name of entry (optional)
            another_key       : another test entry
        
        Show a specific entry on the commandline::
        
          $ gypp -s -k some_key my_passwords.gpg
        
          user     : name of account (required)
          password :
          name     : human readable name of entry (optional)
          note
            optional note. The pipe char indicates that
            line breaks will be preserved, but the
            preceding space on each line will not.
        
          other    : Other properties may be added as needed.
        
        Place password for entry on the clipboard::
        
          $ gypp -k some_key my_passwords.gpg
        
        
        New in version 1.1: ``gypp`` will read a list of sources from a configuration file that
        by default is located at ``$HOME/.config/gypp/gypp.yaml``. The config file is a yaml
        file structured like::
        
          sources:
            source_name_1: path/to/encrypted/file
            source_name_2: path/to/another/encryped/file
        
        ``gypp`` can then be run using a key under ``sources`` to specify the gpg file to read. e.g.::
        
          $ gypp source_name_2
