django-dbtemplates
==================

``dbtemplates`` is a Django app that consists of two parts:

1. It allows you to store templates in your database
2. It provides `template loader`_ that enables Django to load the
   templates from the database

It also features optional support for :ref:`versioned storage <versioned>`
and :ref:`django-admin command <commands>`, integrates with Django's
:ref:`caching system <caching>` and the :ref:`admin actions <admin_actions>`.

Please see https://django-dbtemplates.readthedocs.io/ for more details.
