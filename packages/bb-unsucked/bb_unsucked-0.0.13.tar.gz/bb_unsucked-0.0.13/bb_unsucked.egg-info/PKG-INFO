        # Blackboard Unsucked
        
        _crummy name for a fix of crummy software_
        
        If you are a student or faculty at ODU I'm sure you're no stranger
        to wasting 2-3 hours a day trying to find or post assignments via BlackBoard.
        
        I am concerned with the student's view, but I hope this experiment can
        prove useful for professors as well. The goal is to wrap around existing
        BlackBoard infrastructure and provide a CLI API to access all the important functions
        which usually are trapped behind 4-5 links and a total 20-30 second browser load time.
        
        # Specific Goals
        
         - [x] Login to BB
         - [x] List classes for the current semester only (hide irrelevant ones)
         - [x] List all announcements
         - [x] List assignments for a given class
          - This will have to be sort of intelligent as professors put assignments in different places
         - [ ] Submit files for assignments
         - [ ] View/Post to discussion boards
         - [ ] Caching and Daemon operation, to prevent having to hit the network for most data access
        
        
        # Dependencies
        
        Python3 `requests`, and `BeautifulSoup`, both of which can be 
        installed via `pip3`
        
        # Usage
        
        The fastest setup is to save a `.har` file of a recent Blackboard session someplace,
        then run
        
        ```bash
        # Install the package
        pip3 install --user bb_unsucked
        # Read authentication details from .har
        python3 -m bb_unsucked build-cache downloads/my-session.har
        # use the __main__.py program to list all of your classes
        python3 -m bb_unsucked ls
        ```
        
        ## in a script
        
        the file `demo_usage_in_script.py` has more examples, but the hello world is:
        
        ```python
        import bb_unsucked
        
        bb = bb_unsucked.BBUnsucked()
        
        for my_class in bb.classes():
          print(f"I am in {my_class.course_id}")
        
        ```
        
        ## authentication
        
        To perform the authentication step the most reliable method is to
        save a `.har` file of a recent blackboard session. `bb_unsucked` is
        capable of parsing authentication session cookies out of the file `recent_request.har`.
        
        ![how to save a .har from a browser](howto-save-har.jpg "Saving .HAR")
        
        
        ## Config
        
        `bb-unsucked` reads from config directives first from `/etc/bb-unsucked/config.ini`
        and then from `$HOME/.bb-unsucked/config.ini`. Neither file need to be present,
        but should you want to override a parameter the default config contents would be
        
        ```
        [DEFAULT]
        base_domain = https://www.blackboard.odu.edu
        cookies_file = /j/.bb-unsucked/cookies.bin
        agressive_caching = False
        courses_cache_file = /j/.bb-unsucked/courses-cache.bin
        courses_max_cache_s = 604800
        announcements_cache_file = /j/.bb-unsucked/announcements-cache.bin
        announcements_max_cache_s = 21600
        
        ```
        
        As you can see, the `base_domain` defaults to ODU's blackboard instance,
        but this can be changed to point to any blackboard instance.
        
        My config lists various cache files as being under `/j/` (my home dir)
        because when using defaults `bb-unsucked` will dynamically generate the
        values of `cookies_file`, `courses_cache_file`, and  `announcements_cache_file`.
        
        # Compiling cython binary
        
        Some speed demons will want to optimize performance as much as possible, esp.
        if `bb-unsucked` is going to be used in other scripts. This repo contains
        a makefile which will build the binary `bb-unsucked` when you execute `make bb-unsucked`.
        
        The binary outperforms the python module most effectively when reading
        cached data which requires no network access. It does this by inserting some code,
        `cython_main_interpose.c`, in the generated `.c` file that Cython outputs.
        
        This code is responsible for trying to perform simple tasks without
        the need to jump into a python runtime. good examples are printing help text and listing classes,
        which the module takes 200ms doing and the binary takes 2ms to do.
