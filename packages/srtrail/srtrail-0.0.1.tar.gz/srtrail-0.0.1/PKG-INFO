Description: # srtrail
        Python library to edit SpeedRunners trails.
        
        Use `pip` to install:
        
            $ pip install srtrail
            
        Below is some sample code to get you started. This will open a trail, and make a copy of it.
        
        ```py
        from srtrail import trail
        
        srt = srtrail.Trail()
        srt.load('trail.srt')
        srt.save('copy.srt')
        ```
        
        Once you have the trail, you will need to place it in the `{USER}/Documents/SavedGames/SpeedRunners/CEngineStorage/AllPlayers/Trails/Local/Import/` directory, where `{USER}` is the name of the account you are logged into on your PC. Then, simply start the game and you can use/edit/publish your trail.
