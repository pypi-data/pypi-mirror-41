Description: # reportabug
        A Python tool for collecting information when reporting bugs.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/zooba/reportabug
        pip install reportabug
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        reportabug [MODULE NAMES]
        python -m reportabug [MODULE NAMES]
        ```
        
        GitHub-compatible Markdown will be output to the console. You should copy-paste this
        into your bug report.
        
        On Windows, you can pipe to `clip.exe` to store the output on the clipboard.
        
        ```
        python -m reportabug [MODULE NAMES] | clip
        ```
        
        Some personal information will be hidden, though a non-reversible summary of its contents is included as this information may be important. **Remember to review your report for personal information before sharing.**
        
        See [issue #1](https://github.com/zooba/reportabug/issues/1) for an example report.
        
        ## API
        
        Currently, `reportabug` has no public API. However, modules specified on the command line may expose a `_reportabug_info` generator to provide additional info.
        
        ```python
        def _reportabug_info(arg):
            yield 'summary', 'summary line of text'
            yield 'key', VALUE
        ```
        
        Each key/value pair will be added to the result section for the module. If the `summary` key exists, it will be added to a summary section if one exists for the selected output format.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        Contributions are welcome. Feel free to file an issue or PR.
        
        Requests to add further information to the report should include supporting evidence, such as a bug that would have been diagnosed more quickly with the additional information.
        
        ## Privacy
        
        No information is transmitted by this tool. Please review and remove personal information from the generated reports before sharing with other people.
