Description: # HADeploy
        
        HADeploy is a tool specially designed to deploy application in BigData/NoSQL context with Hadoop cluster as first target.
        
        In such context, deploying an application is not only matter of deploying some jar in some place. It also means creating a bunch of associated resources such as Hive table, Kafka topic, HBase table, HDFS folders and files, systems account, etc.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        You will find documentation [at this location](http://www.hadeploy.com/)
        
        ## Base principles
        
        ### Application manifest
        
        An application can be fully described in one file, hosting all components and resources description.
        
        ### Infrastructure independency
        
        Application file is independent of target physical infrastructure. This target is defined in another file and HADeploy will take care of the merge on deployment
        
        ### Environment independency.
        
        In the same way, the application file is independent of the environment (DEV, INT, PPRD, PROD,..). This ensure coherency and repeatable deployments among these contexts
        
        ### Declarative programming and reconciliation
        
        HADeploy is a purely descriptive tool. As such usage will consist of defining the expected state of the deployed application and let the tool perform the reconciliation between expected and actual state.
        
        ### Idempotence
        
        Such principle means HADeploy is a fully idempotent tools, as if expected state match the actual ones, the tool will not perform any further actions.
        
        ### Application instance isolation.
        
        A typical deployment pattern allowed by HADeploy is to define ‘Application Container’, or ‘Application Lane’. Then several instance (or version) of an application can be installed and run in parallel.
        
        ### Kerberos support
        
        HADeploy is able to deploy application on a Hadoop cluster secured by Kerberos. 
        
        ### Rights management
        
        HADeploy will manage all permissions associated to the deployed components and resources.
        
        ### Plugins architecture
        
        HADeploy is designed with a highly modular plugins architecture, thus allowing easy third party extension.
        
        ### Application Removal
        
        As HADeploy knows about all the components of your application, it provides a REMOVAL mode, which restores the target cluster in its initial state.
        
        ### Open Source
        
        HADeploy is a fully open source project, under GNU General Public License.
