        R2-45 monitors overall volatile memory usage and when memory usage goes
        to or beyond what it considers too far (meaning that the poor system
        switches to super-slow swap memory) it kills progressively a list of
        programs it has in its internal blacklist. As it does this it notifies
        you of its actions and, when it has done all it can based on its
        blacklist, it sends a final message of warning. It is not perfect, but
        it is trying. And really, the pursuit of a positive contribution to
        reality is really all for which anyone or script can hope.
        
        setup
        =====
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install r245
        
        usage
        =====
        
        Just run it.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            r245
        
        You can ask it for help if you want to learn how to specify via command
        line options and arguments the critical RAM usage limit or a custom
        blacklist.
        
        .. code:: bash
