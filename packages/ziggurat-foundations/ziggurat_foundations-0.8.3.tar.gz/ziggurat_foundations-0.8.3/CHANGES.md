## [0.8.3] - 2019-02-09
### Added
* pyramid extensions can now accept `session_provider_callable` not only as a path to callable but
  also as plain callable object
* tests for pyramid extensions
### Changed
* fixed deprecated usage of `set_request_property` (thanks Francis Charette Migneault)

## [0.8.2] - 2018-11-08
### Fixed
* Fixed migrations under Mysql 8.x

## [0.8.0] [0.8.1] - 2018-09-28
### Changed
* [Breaking] Most of deprecated model methods got removed, please use services instead
* [Breaking] ziggurat_model_init has now explicit order of model classes set

## [0.7.3] - 2018-02-19
### Changed
* Use pbkdf2_sha256 by default (bcypt hashes will work and will be migrated on first login for users)

**Important**

By default `check_password` will migrate your existing bcrypt hashes to pbkdf2_sha256, if you want to keep bcrypt,
you can either pass `passwordmanager_schemes` list to `ziggurat_model_init` or use your own passwordmanager.


## [0.7.2] - 2018-02-17
### Changed
* Fixed some minor issues that resulted in bad migrations when someone used `autogenerate in alembic`
* Added a way to read sqlalchemy.url from environment variable (thanks Ren√© Jochum)


## [0.7.1] - 2017-02-19
### Changed
* fixed tree ordering for nested elements
* fixed `perm_by_group_and_perm_name` method


## [0.7.0] - 2016-11-25
### Added
* Introduced ResourceTreeService for nested resource management
  (currently only PostgreSQL support is implemented)
* lots of new tests
### Changed
* added deprecation warnings
* [breaking] code reorganization that might break existing code
* [breaking] _ziggurat_services is now a list

* models are decoupled from services that interact with models
  (all model querying methods now live in services)

**BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES**

    * ziggurat_foundations.models doesn't import all the models anymore
      every model now lives in separate file
    * permission related functions now live in permissions module

* Release: 0.5.6
* user model gains security date column
* minor bugfixes

2015-06-07

2015-04-24
----------
* Release: 0.5.2
* resource.users_for_perm() now accepts `limit_group_permissions` param that
  that makes it return just group with perm name instead tuples including every
  user/perm pairs

----------
* Release: 0.5.1
* Group.resources_with_possible_perms() added

2015-04-17

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE API CHANGES
    * ResourceMixin.users_for_perm() accepts additional parameters group_ids, and user_ids
      to limit the amount of results if needed
    * User.permissions, Resource.perms_for_user, Resource.direct_perms_for_user,
      Resource.group_perms_for_user, Resource.users_for_perm_detailed, Resource.users_for_perm
      now return list of detailed PermissionTuple's instead simple [id, perm_name] pairs
      this will break your application
      You can use ziggurat_foundations.utils.permission_to_04_acls() to convert
      the new tuples to pre 0.5 format

2012-11-28
----------
* First Alpha Release 0.3 - This release should have a fairly stable API
* Hundreds of small and big changes - based on all great feedback we are now
  using surrogate pkeys instead of natural pkeys for most models.
  As result of this few methods started accepting id's instead usernames,
  so consider yourself warned that this release might be bw. incompatible a bit
  with your application
* At this point all tests should pass on mysql, postgresql, sqlite

.. hint::
    What "previous revision ID" means?
    If you are updating the package that never was stamped with
    alembic you may need to stamp the database manually with following revision id,
    from this point onwards you will be able to update schemas automaticly.
    Alembic 0.3.3+ (or current trunk for 2012-05-27) is required for this to function properly
