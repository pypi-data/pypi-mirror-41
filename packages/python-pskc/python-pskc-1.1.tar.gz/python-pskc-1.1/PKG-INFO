Description: Python module for handling PSKC files
        =====================================
        
        A Python module to handle Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) files as
        defined in `RFC 6030 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6030>`_. PSKC files are
        used to transport and provision symmetric keys and key meta data (seed files)
        to different types of crypto modules, commonly one-time password systems or
        other authentication devices.
        
        This module can be used to extract keys from PSKC files for use in an OTP
        authentication system. The module can also be used for authoring PSKC files.
        
        This module should be able to handle most common PSKC files.

        API
        ---
        
        The module provides a straightforward API that is mostly geared towards
        parsing existing PSKC files.
        
        Extracting key material from encrypted PSKC files is as simple as:
        
        >>> from pskc import PSKC
        >>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030/figure7.pskcxml')
        >>> pskc.encryption.derive_key('qwerty')
        >>> for key in pskc.keys:
        ...     print('%s %s' % (key.serial, str(key.secret.decode())))
        987654321 12345678901234567890
        
        Writing am encrypted PSKC file is as simple as:
        
        >>> pskc = PSKC()
        >>> key = pskc.add_key(
        ...     id='456', secret='987654321', manufacturer='Manufacturer',
        ...     algorithm = 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:keyprov:pskc:hotp')
        >>> pskc.encryption.setup_pbkdf2('passphrase')
        >>> pskc.write('output.pskcxml')
        
        The key object has a number of properties. See the pskc.key.Key documentation
        for details.
        
        
        Security considerations
        -----------------------
        
        This code handles private key material and is written in Python. No
        precautions have been taken to lock pages in memory to prevent swapping. Also
        no attempt is currently made to securely dispose of memory that may have held
        private key material.
