    Now for the composite stuff. We need to separate all our graphs into mini-graphs.
    Each minigraph must contain...
          ...its genes (`LegoSequence`)
          ...the fusion points (`LegoPoint`)
              - showing where that graph fits into the big picture.
              
    In this stage we collect "gene_sets", representing the set of sequences in each minigraph.
    We also make a dictionary of "gene_set_to_fusion", representing which fusion points are matched to each "gene set".
    
    :param no_super:    Drop supersets from the trees. You want this.
                        Turn if off to see the supersets in the final graph (your NRFG will therefore be a disjoint union of multiple possibilities!).
