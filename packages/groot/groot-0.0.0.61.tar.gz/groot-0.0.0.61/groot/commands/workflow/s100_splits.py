    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    | Some of our graphs may have contradictory information.                                                     |
    | To resolve this we perform a consensus.                                                                    |
    | We define all the graphs by their splits, then see whether the splits are supported by the majority.       |
    |                                                                                                            |
    | A couple of implementation notes:                                                                          |
    | 1. I've not used the most efficient algorithm, however this is fast enough for the purpose and it is much  |
    |    easier to explain what we're doing. For a fast algorithm see Jansson 2013, which runs in O(nk) time.    |
    | 2. We're calculating much more data than we need to, since we only reconstruct the subsets of the graphs   |
    |    pertinent to the domains of the composite gene. However, again, this allows us to get the consensus     |
    |    stuff out of the way early so we can perform the more relevant composite stage independent from the     |
    |    consensus.                                                                                              |
