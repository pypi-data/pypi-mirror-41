Description: 
        This is an intelligence music retrieval engine
        that takes in short musical phrases as a search
        query and returns a best match from our database.
        The intent is to let users discover the songs that
        have forever been stuck in their heads whose names
        elude them.
        
        This package uses Python 3.6 and support is not 
        guaranteed for other versions.
