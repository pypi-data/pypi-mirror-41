Description: 
        InVirtualEnv
        ============
        
        The invirtualenv package contains scripts for deploying
        applications written in Python inside Python virtualenv.
        
        These included scripts can:
        
        * Create native packages via plugins that contain a Python application installed inside.  Currently there are plugins to create rpms and docker containers.
        * Create a specified operating system platform using an RPM package list.
        * Create a Python virtualenv, when running as root the virtualenv can be
          deployed so that it can be manipulated by another user.
        * Deploy Python packages into the virtualenv from a pip
          requirements file.
        
        The script can be configured using command line arguments or all configuration
        can be defined in a single deploy.conf file.
