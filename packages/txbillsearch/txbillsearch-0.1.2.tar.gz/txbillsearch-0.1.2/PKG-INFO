Description: A thin, incomplete Python library wrapper around the [Texas Legislature Online
        Bill Search](https://capitol.texas.gov/Search/BillSearch.aspx).
        
        ## Install and Test
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install --user pipenv
        ...
        $ cd TxBillSearch
        ...
        $ pipenv install
        ... installs Requests and BeatifulSoup 4 ...
        $ pipenv shell
        (TxLegOnlineScraper3-_s_xUwQa) $ python txbillsearch.py
        1604 bills found...
        result 1 of 1604: HB 1 by Zerwas H Filed 2019-01-23
        result 2 of 1604: HB 20 by Capriglione H Filed 2019-01-24
        ...
        result 41 of 1604: HB 59 by Swanson H Filed 2018-11-12
        (TxLegOnlineScraper3-_s_xUwQa) $ exit # from the pipenv environment
        $
        ```
        
        ## Module Usage
        
        The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the end of
        [txbillsearch.py](txbillsearch.py) gives a notion of how to use this module.
        The most useful exposed function is `search()`.
        
        ```python
        # NOTICE: We chopped off the 'ID=abc123DEF' query param!
        SESSION_86_BILLS = 'https://capitol.texas.gov/Search/BillSearchResults.aspx?NSP=1&SPL=False&SPC=False&SPA=True&SPS=False&Leg=86&Sess=R&ChamberH=True&ChamberS=True&BillType=B;JR;CR;R;;;&AuthorCode=&SponsorCode=&ASAndOr=O&IsPA=True&IsJA=False&IsCA=False&IsPS=True&IsJS=False&IsCS=False&CmteCode=&CmteStatus=&OnDate=&FromDate=&ToDate=&FromTime=&ToTime=&LastAction=False&Actions=S000;S001;H001;&AAO=O&Subjects=&SAO=&TT=' # NO ID!
        
        id, search_results = search(SESSION_86_BILLS)
        
        # This is just a very simple demonstration that we can actually get 
        # search results directly from BillSearchResults.aspx.
        print('{} bills found...'.format(search_results.count))
        for index, bill in enumerate(search_results.bills):
            if index > 40:
                break
        
            print('result {} of {}: {}'.format(
                index+1, 
                search_results.count, 
                bill))
        ```
        
        ## Technical Details
        
        For some reason,
        [BillSearchResults.aspx](https://capitol.texas.gov/Search/BillSearchResults.aspx)
        requires that you supply an ID, generated on
        [BillSearch.aspx](https://capitol.texas.gov/Search/BillSearch.aspx). This ID
        must be "fresh"; that is it must have been generated less than 24-ish hours ago
        (I don't know the exact time interval). Without a "fresh" ID,
        BillSearchResults.aspx displays "No bills were found matching the entered
        search criteria." or redirects the client back to BillSearch.aspx.
        
        
        This ID is generated during the ASP.NET
        POSTback that occurs to BillSearch.aspx after you have selected your search
        criteria, but before you are redirected to BillSearchResults.aspx:

        ## Disclaimer
        
        I made my best effort to read through the Texas Legislature Online Terms and
        Conditions, and found nothing that prohibited automated/programmatic use or
        access of this information. If there's a better way to do this (e.g., a *real*
        web service) I'd love to know about it, and would much prefer to use it to the
        wasteful and inconvenient method developed herein.
