Description: Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python,
        and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts.
        It features a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging
        and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data
        exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection and beautiful visualization
        capabilities of a scientific package.
        
        Furthermore, Spyder offers built-in integration with many popular
        scientific packages, including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, QtConsole,
        Matplotlib, SymPy, and more.
        
        Beyond its many built-in features, Spyder's abilities can be extended even
        further via first- and third-party plugins.
        
        Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing you to build
        upon its functionality and embed its components, such as the interactive
        console or advanced editor, in your own software.
