        ## Introduction
        
        Python package `smms.py` is a command line toolkit for managing images at [https://sm.ms](https://sm.ms). It provides simple and quick utilities for you to upload, delete and query personal images.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### install
        
        Simply install with one line command `pip install smms.py`.
        
        ### upload
        
        Uploading images to [https://sm.ms](https://sm.ms) is pretty simple when using `smms.py`. For instance:
        
        ```bash
        smms upload --help
        # Usage: smms upload [OPTIONS] [IMAGES]...
        # Upload images and record commits, shell-style wildcards supported
        # Options:
        # -c, --comment TEXT  commentation strings, making comments for images
        # --help              Show this message and exit.
        smms upload $HOME/images/*.jpg -c 'example upload'
        # upload all jpg-format images in ~/images/ and comment them
        ```
        
        ### delete
        
        Deleting images on [https://sm.ms](https://sm.ms) directly on browsers are sort of complicated. But thanks to the official API, we have access to remove images from the server.
        
        ```bash
        smms delete --help
        # Usage: smms delete [OPTIONS]
        # Remove specific images from server
        # Options:
        # -A, --All           ALL flag, indicating deleting all images
        # -d, --dates TEXT    ISO date strings, specifying dates to delete
        # -p, --pattern TEXT  Search pattern, like <property>:<shell-style wildcards>
        # --yes               Confirm delete events
        # --help              Show this message and exit.
        smms delete -d 2001-01-01 -d 2018-06-26 -A
        # Delete all images uploaded on 2001-01-01 or 2018-06-26
        smms remove -A -p 'filename:bak_*.jpg'
        # Delete all backup jpg-format images
        ```
        
        It works pretty well. For match patterns, you have four properties to choose from on hand: `filename`, `url`, `delete ` and `comment`. You may view `~/.sm.ms.history` for clearer comprehension.
        
        ### query
        
        Command `query` enables you to filter and view your local history. Yet another example:
        
        ```bash
        smms query --help
        #Usage: smms query [OPTIONS]
        # Query records from local history
        # Options:
        # -d, --dates TEXT    ISO date strings, specifying dates to query
        # -p, --pattern TEXT  Search pattern, like <property>:<shell-style wildcards>
        # --help              Show this message and exit.
        smms query -d 2018-06-26 -d 2018-06-27 -p 'comment:backup*'
        # Query all images uploaded in dates above commented with 'backup'
        ```
