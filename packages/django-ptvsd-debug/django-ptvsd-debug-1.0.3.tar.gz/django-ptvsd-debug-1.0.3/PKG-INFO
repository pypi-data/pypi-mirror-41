Description: # Django PTVSD Debug
        
        A little manage.py tweak to attach a PTVSD debugger during runserver. 
        Built with WSL development in mind since we have to treat it like remote in apps like VSCode (for now...)
        
        ## Usage
        
        
        1. Add django_ptvsd to your INSTALLED_APPS _above_ Django
        
        ```
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            'django_ptvsd',
            ...
        )
        ```
        
        2. pass `--ptvsd` flag to runserver command
        
        ```
        django-admin runserver --ptvsd
        ```
        
        ## Django Settings
        
        `PTVSD_ENABLE = False` Attach PTVSD by default. No need for `--ptvsd` flag
        
        `PTVSD_REMOTE_ADDRESS = '0.0.0.0'` - Which address to listen on
        
        `PTVSD_REMOTE_PORT = 5678` - Which port to listen on
        
        `PTVSD_WAIT_FOR_ATTACH = False` - Whether or not to wait for attach before continuing
