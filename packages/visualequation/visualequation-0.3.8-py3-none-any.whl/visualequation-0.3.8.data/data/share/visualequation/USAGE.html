<p>Visual Equation is expected to be user-friendly and intuitive, so it should not be difficult to use if you understand its usage. Basically:</p>

<p>Instead of a cursor, you navigate with a "ghost" that surrounds blocks of the equation, from single symbols to arguments, operators and the entire equation. Change the ghost's selection and insert characters at the direction in which the ghost is facing by pressing keys on the keyboard or clicking symbols in the bottom panel. If the ghost surrounds a square, as when you open the program, you overwrite the square.</p>

<p>These are the main keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>LEFT</b>:
Change the direction of the ghost to the left or navigate backwards.</li>

<li><b>RIGHT</b> or <b>TAB</b>:
Change the direction of the ghost to right or navigate forwards.</li>

<li><b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b>:
Put a superindex or subindex in the direction pointed by the ghost.</li>

<li><b>DELETE</b> or <b>BACKSPACE</b>:
Remove current selection. If it was the entire argument of an operator, a square will remain so you can change it by something else.</li>

<li><b>Left-click</b> on an element of the symbols panel:
Insert the element where the ghost is facing.</li>

<li><b>SHIFT + Left-click</b> on an element of the symbols panel (<b>VERY handy</b>):
If the element is an operator, the selection is replaced by the operator and its first argument is set to the selection. (The first argument is the one represented by dots) If the element is a symbol, the selection is replaced by the symbol.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may learn also the short-cuts noted in the menu.</p>
