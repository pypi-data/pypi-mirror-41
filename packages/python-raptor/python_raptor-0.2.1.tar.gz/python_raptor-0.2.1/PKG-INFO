Description: # Raptor
        
        A Easy Way To Benchmark Your Code.
        
        # How To Use It
        Step 1: First You Will Need To Create A Benchmark File For Your Project
        
        ```python3
        """to_benchmark.py"""
        
        #Add All Your Setup
        import math
        
        
        #Write Your Benchmarking Functions
        def bench_square_root():
            """Name Your Function Starting With bench. Or Raptor Wont Detect It
            Also the function should not take any arguments"""
            return math.sqrt(25)
            
        def bench_multiply():
            return 5 ** 25
        ```
        
        
        Step 2: Download raptor.py
        ```
        pip install python-raptor
        ```
        
        Then, Run This In Your Terminal
        
        **NOTICE: The -t Argument Takes An Integer Which Tells Raptor How Many Times
        Should Each Benchmarking Function Run**
        ```
        raptor.py to_benchmark.py -t 10000
        ```
        
        Step 3: See The  Output. Voilaaaaa!!!!!!!!!
        
        Output
        ```
        ========== Bench Marking ===========
        [bench_square_root] Took 0.0025385 Seconds For 10000 Run(s)
        [bench_multiply] Took 0.0010813999999999997 Seconds For 10000 Run(s)
        ```
        
        
        
        # Future Features
        1. I want to add an history, which can show you how much faster or slower your program has gotten
        2. I want to add colored output
        3. I want to add better exception handling
