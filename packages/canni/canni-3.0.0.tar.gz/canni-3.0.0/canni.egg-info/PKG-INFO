        =====
        
        If you are looking for the generated html code example (Triple Trouble):

        If you are looking for the real, up-to-date versions, please use the following links:
        
        * Triple Trouble: https://networkjanitor.gitlab.io/xutt/

        Technical Design Goals/Criteria
        -------------------------------
        
        * lightweight
        * single page
        * avoid javascript as often as possible (tabs with css, copy requires javascript :[ )
        * offline portability (can save the file and open it from harddrive - still works)
        * easy to use
        * dataset source type as `xutt <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt>`_ (same as the linux terminal version of Canni: `bronk <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/bronk>`_)
        
        Info about changes to the dataset
        ---------------------------------
        
        Sometimes when I feel like it, I'll update the used dataset here from the `xutt <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt>`_ repo to generate a more up-to-date example.
        If you have any specific change requests (regarding the dataset used for the example), please feel free to create issues (or preferably pull requests) in the `xutt <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt>`_ repo.
        
        TODOs
        -----
        
        * write a demo dataset instead of using xutt to demonstrate things without the triple trouble/guildwars2 terminology
