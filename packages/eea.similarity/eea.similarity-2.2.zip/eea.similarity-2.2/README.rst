Introduction
============

EEA Similarity is a Plone_ add-on which provides content suggestions based on similarity scores to a search string. It uses NLP algorithms like TF-IDF (frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).

Initial use case is to provide a list of possible duplicates when adding content (based on the entered title).

Installation
============

zc.buildout
-----------
If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Update your buildout.cfg file:

  * Add ``eea.similarity`` to the list of eggs to install
  * Tell the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_ recipe to install a ZCML slug

  ::

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs =
      ...
      eea.similarity

    zcml =
      ...
      eea.similarity

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

  $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.


Getting started
===============

1. Go to **Site Setup > Add-ons** and install **EEA Similarity**
2. Create IDF index by calling **@@create_idf_index** Browser view on site root.
   If you have **plone.app.async** installed, it will add a daily job to async queue,
   otherwise you'll have to setup an external cron job to call this periodically.
3. Customize settings via Site Setup > EEA Similarity Settings


Dependencies
============

`EEA Similarity`_ has the following dependencies:
  - stemming
  - gensim (which in turn depends on numpy and scipy)

On CentOS you need to install:
  - blas-devel
  - lapack-devel
  - gcc-fortran

On Debian/Ubuntu you need to install:
  - libblas-dev
  - liblapack
  - gfortran

Possible issues with scipy and numpy:
-------------------------------------
Due to a bug in scipy, it is possible that the packages will not install when
running buildout. There are two solutions/options:

1. Install them with easy_install pip before running the buildout.
2. Update `zc.buildout`_ to version 2.9.0 and activate the wheel support via `buildout.wheel`_ and the dependencies will be installed normally.
