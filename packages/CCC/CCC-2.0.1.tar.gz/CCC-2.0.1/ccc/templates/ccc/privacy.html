                    Cloud
                    Custom Solutions may employ a common technique usually referred to as
                    &quot;pixel tracking&quot; to measure the effectiveness of marketing
                    and advertisements, as well as compile aggregate usage statistics.
                    Pixel tracking, which may be used in connection with advertisements
                    on other sites, on the Website or in e-mail messages, involves the
                    use of pixel tags (also known as &quot;clear gifs,&quot; &quot;Web
                    beacons&quot; or &quot;1-by-1 gifs&quot;) that are not visible to the
                    user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. For
                    example, if you visit the Website from an advertisement on another
                    site, the pixel tag will reference the cookie you received when you
                    clicked on the advertisement. The pixel tag also may register this
                    activity with a business partner to allow us to count the number of
                    times or when an advertisement is accessed. This data is collected
                    for use in our marketing and research. Personally identifiable
                    information about you is not collected by pixel tracking, nor is any
                    tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used
                    for any other purpose other than to report Website activity to us.</font></font>
