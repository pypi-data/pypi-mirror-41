Description: # keithleygui
        A high-level user interface for Keithley 2600 series instruments which allows
        the user to configure, record and save voltage sweeps such as transfer and
        output measurements. Since there typically is no need to provide a live stream
        of readings from the Keithley, the data from an IV-curve is buffered locally on
        the instrument and only transferred to CustomXepr after completion of a
        measurement.
