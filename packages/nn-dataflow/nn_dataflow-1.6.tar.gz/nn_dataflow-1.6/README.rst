Neural Network Dataflow Scheduling
==================================

This Python tool allows you to explore the energy-efficient dataflow scheduling
for neural networks (NNs), including array mapping, loop blocking and
reordering, and parallel partitioning.

For hardware, we assume an Eyeriss-style NN accelerator [Chen16]_, i.e., a 2D
array of processing elements (PEs) with a local register file in each PE, and a
global SRAM buffer shared by all PEs. We further support a tiled architecture
with multiple nodes that can partition and process the NN computations in
parallel. Each node is an Eyeriss-style engine as above.

In software, we decouple the dataflow scheduling into three subproblems:

- Array mapping, which deals with mapping one 2D convolution computation (one
  2D ifmap convolves with one 2D filter to get one 2D ofmap) onto the hardware
  PE array. We support row stationary mapping [Chen16]_.
- Loop blocking and reordering, which decides the order between all 2D
  convolutions by blocking and reordering the nested loops. We support
  exhaustive search over all blocking and reordering schemes [Yang16]_, and
  analytical bypass solvers [Gao17]_.
- Partitioning, which partitions the NN computations for parallel processing.
  We support batch partitioning, fmap partitioning, output partitioning, input
  partitioning, and the combination between them (hybrid) [Gao17]_. We use
  layer-wise greedy beam search.

See the details in our ASPLOS'17 paper [Gao17]_.

If you use this tool in your work, we kindly request that you reference our
paper(s) below, and send us a citation of your work.

Usage
-----

First, define the NN structure in ``nn_dataflow/nns``. We already defined
several popular NNs for you, including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogLeNet, ResNet-152,
etc.

Then, use ``nn_dataflow/tools/nn_dataflow_search.py`` to search for the optimal
dataflow for the NN. For detailed options, type::

    > python ./nn_dataflow/tools/nn_dataflow_search.py -h

You can specify NN batch size and word size, PE array dimensions, number of
tile nodes, register file and global buffer capacity, and the energy cost of
all components. Note that, the energy cost of array bus should be the average
energy of transferring the data from the buffer to one PE, *not* local neighbor
transfer; the unit static energy cost should be the static energy of *all*
nodes in one clock cycle.

Other options include:

- ``-g``, ``--goal``: ``E``, ``D``, or ``ED``. the optimization goal, e(nergy),
  d(elay), or ED product.
- ``--mem-type``: ``2D`` or ``3D``. With 2D memory, memory channels are only on
  the four corners of the chip; with 3D memory, memory channels are on the top
  of all tile nodes (one per each).
- ``--bus-width``: the multicast bus bit width in the PE array for one data
  type. Set to 0 to ignore multicast overheads.
- ``--dram-bw``: ``float`` or ``inf``. Total DRAM bandwidth for all tile nodes,
  in bytes per cycle.
- ``--disable-bypass``: a combination of ``i``, ``o``, ``f``, whether to
  disallow global buffer bypass for ifmaps, ofmaps, and weights.
- ``--solve-loopblocking``: whether to use analytical bypass solvers for loop
  blocking and reordering. See [Gao17]_.
- ``--hybrid-partitioning``: whether to use hybrid partitioning in [Gao17]_.
  If not enabled, use naive partitioning, i.e., fmap partitioning for CONV
  layers, and output partitioning for FC layers.
- ``--batch-partitioning`` and ``--ifmap-partitioning``: whether the hybrid
  partitioning also explores batch and input partitioning.
