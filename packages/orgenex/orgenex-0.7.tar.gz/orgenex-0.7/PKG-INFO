        [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is used to tranlate the note content
        to the org-mode document. On Ubuntu, installing it is straightforward:
        
            apt-get install pandoc
        
        and installing orgenex 
        
            pip install orgenex

        A short list of features that it's capable of 
        
        -   Tags are imported
        -   All attachments are imported as attachments in the org document
        -   Fast and memory efficient
            A 4GB export consisting of 3000 notes took less than three minutes
            to convert and used no more than 0.2% of memory.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Assuming your export is named Evernote.enex the following command will
        create the org-mode file `out.org`. Attachments are stored in the
        `data/` directory relative to where you run the command.
        
            orgenex Evernote.enex > out.org
