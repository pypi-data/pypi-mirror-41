Description: # orgenex
        
        orgenex converts an Evernote export into an emacs org-mode document.
        
        ## Installation
        
        [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]] is used to tranlate the note content
        to the org-mode document. On Ubuntu, installing it is straightforward:
        ```
        apt-get install pandoc
        ```
        and installing orgenex 
        ```
        pip install orgenex
        ```
        
        ## Features
        
        A short list of features that it's capable of 
        
        * Tags are imported
        * All attachments are imported as attachments in the org document
        * Fast and memory efficient
          A 4GB export consisting of 3000 notes took 4 minutes to convert and
          used no more than 0.2% of memory.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Assuming your export is named Evernote.enex the following command will
        create the org-mode file `out.org`. Attachments are stored in the
        `data/` directory relative to where you run the command.
        
        ```
        orgenex Evernote.enex > out.org
        ```
        
        ## Plans
        
        * Switch to create links that will display images inline
        * libxml2 might be a bit faster
