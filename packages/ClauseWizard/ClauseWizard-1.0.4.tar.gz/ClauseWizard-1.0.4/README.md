[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Shadark/ClauseWizard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Shadark/ClauseWizard) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ClauseWizard.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ClauseWizard) [![Python 3.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue.svg)]

# ClauseWizard
Python-based JSON parser for files from the Clausewitz engine, used in multiple Paradox Interactive games.

Currently supports both savegames and files from:

* **Europa Universalis 4**
* **Crusader Kings 2**
* **Hearts of Iron 4**
* **Stellaris**

---

* Compressed games: **supported**.
* Multiplayer games: **supported**.
* Ironman games: _not supported_ (in development). If the ironman save is not in binary format, it should work with this library.
_(For HoI4 games, you need to change `save_as_binary=yes` option from `yes` to `no` on your `settings.txt` configuration file)._

##Getting started

###Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install ClauseWizard
```

Binary packages will be available for release _Soonâ„¢_.

Python version is 3.7, will test other versions.

## Usage

```python
import ClauseWizard

ClauseWizard.cwparse(file) # returns a list of tokens
ClauseWizard.cwformat(tokens) # returns a JSON-formatted string
```

You can also run `Scripts\CWParser` from your Python setup directory.
