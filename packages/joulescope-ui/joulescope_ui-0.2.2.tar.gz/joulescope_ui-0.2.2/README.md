Welcome to Joulescope™!  Joulescope is an inexpensive, precision DC energy 
analyzer that enables you to build better products. 
Joulescope™ accurately and simultaneously measures the voltage and current 
supplied to your target device, and it then computes power and energy. 
For more information on Joulescope, see 
[www.joulescope.com](https://www.joulescope.com).

The Joulescope graphical user interface runs on a host PC 
and communicates with the Joulescope device over USB.  The application
source code is available at https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui.
In addition to the graphical user interface, the source code is
a Python 3.6+ package.
