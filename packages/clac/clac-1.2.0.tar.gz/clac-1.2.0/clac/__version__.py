"""Version specification for the clac package

The `__major__`, `__minor__`, and `__patch__` attributes follow the semantic
version spec, in X.Y.Z format.  `__patch__` may be auto-incremented by
build tools in the future, but `__major__` and `__minor__` will only be
incremented manually.

`__version__` allows for API compatibility comparison, and is defined as a
2-tuple: `(__major__, __minor__).`

`__release__` is the semantic version compatible string in 'X.Y.Z' format.
"""

__major__: int = 1
__minor__: int = 2
__patch__: int = 0

__version__ = (__major__, __minor__)
__release__: str = f'{__major__}.{__minor__}.{__patch__}'
