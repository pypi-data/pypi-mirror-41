microcache
==========

|Latest Version| |Build Status|

A Really! Small! Cache! for python 2 and 3.

Why?
----

Working on a totally separate project, I found myself wanting to use
`funcy.memoize <http://funcy.readthedocs.org/en/stable/calc.html#memoize>`__\ …a
lot. There was a major problem, though: I couldn’t test with it. There
was no (obvious) way to turn it off. It was making me crazy, so I spent
a few hours writing a small module (even smaller than this, originally)
to suit the memoization needs, with a hook to turn it off for testing.
When I got to the end of my feature sprint for that project, I decided
it made more sense to spin it out into its own project, so here we are!

Current features
----------------

-  Simple upsert and get workflow
-  TTLs for expiring cache items
-  Decorator for “memoization”
-  Enabling and disabling functionality, including a context manager
-  Work directly on the imported module… no additional instantiation
   (unless you want to)

Installation
------------

::

   pip install microcache

Examples
--------

Basic usage

.. code:: python

   >>> import microcache
   >>> microcache.has('key')
   False
   >>> microcache.get('key')
   CACHE_MISS
   >>> microcache.get('key', default='default')
   'default'
   >>> microcache.upsert('key', 'value')
   >>> microcache.get('key')
   'value'
   >>> microcache.disable()
   >>> microcache.get('key')
   CACHE_DISABLED

Decorator and context manager

.. code:: python

   import microcache
   import time

   @microcache.this
   def somefunc():
       time.sleep(5)
       return "this will be cached, and you won't have to wait a second time!"

   def test_somefunc():
       somefunc()
       somefunc()
       with microcache.temporarily_disabled():
           # now we'll have to wait again
           somefunc()
