# SimpleYoutubeData

A wrapper for Google's YoutubeDataAPI wrapper for python.

Simplifies a bunch of stuff.

## Installation

`pip install simpleyoutubedata`

## Purpose?

I made this mainly to make authentication with the Google YoutubeDataAPI really easy,
as well as have all the objects that Google responds with as classes.

## Other Notices

This may never be completed, and will not be updated with the official API
