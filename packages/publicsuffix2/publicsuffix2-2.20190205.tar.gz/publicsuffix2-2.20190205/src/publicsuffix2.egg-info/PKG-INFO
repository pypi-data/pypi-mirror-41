Description: Public Suffix List module for Python
        ====================================
        
        This module allows you to get the public suffix of a domain name using the
        Public Suffix List from http://publicsuffix.org
        
        A public suffix is a domain suffix under which you can register domain
        names. Some examples of public suffixes are ".com", ".co.uk" and "pvt.k12.wy.us".
        Accurately knowing the public suffix of a domain is useful when handling
        web browser cookies, highlighting the most important part of a domain name
        in a user interface or sorting URLs by web site.
        
        This Python module includes with a copy of the Public Suffix List so that it is
        usable out of the box. Newer versions try to provide reasonably fresh copies of
        this list. It also includes a convenience method to fetch the latest list.
        
        The code is a fork of the publicsuffix package and uses the same base API.
        You just need to import publicsuffix2 instead
        
        The code is MIT-licensed and the publicsuffix data list is MPL-2.0-licensed.
        
        
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install with::
        
            pip install publicsuffix2
        
        The module provides a function to query a domain name::
        
            >>> from publicsuffix2 import get_public_suffix
            >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.com')
            'example.com'
            >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.co.uk')
            'example.co.uk'
            >>> get_public_suffix('www.super.example.co.uk')
            'example.co.uk'
        
        This function loads and caches the public suffix list.
        
        For more control, there is also a class that parses a Public
        Suffix List and allows the same queries on individual domain names::
        
            >>> from publicsuffix2 import PublicSuffixList
            >>> psl = PublicSuffixList()
            >>> psl.get_public_suffix('www.example.com')
            'example.com'
            >>> psl.get_public_suffix('www.example.co.uk')
            'example.co.uk'
            >>> psl.get_public_suffix('www.super.example.co.uk')
            'example.co.uk'
        
        Note that the ``host`` part of an URL can contain strings that are
        not plain DNS domain names (IP addresses, Punycode-encoded names, name in
        combination with a port number or a username, etc.). It is up to the
        caller to ensure only domain names are passed to the get_public_suffix()
        method.
        
        
        The get_public_suffix() function and the PublicSuffixList class initializer accept
        an optional argument pointing to a public suffix file. This can either be a file
        path, an iterable of public suffix lines, or a file-like object pointing to an
        opened list::
        
            >>> from publicsuffix import get_public_suffix
            >>> psl_file = 'path to some psl data file'
            >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.com', psl_file)
            'example.com'
        
        Note that when using get_public_suffix() a global cache keeps the latest provided
        suffix list data.  This will use the cached latest loaded above::
        
            >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.co.uk')
            'example.co.uk'
        
        
        To update the bundled suffix list use the provided setup.py command::
        
            python setup.py update_psl
            
        The update list will be saved in `src/publicsuffix2/public_suffix_list.dat`
        and you can build a new wheel with this bundled data.
        
        Alternatively, there is a fetch() function that will fetch the latest version
        of a Public Suffix data file from https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat
        You can use it this way::
        
            >>> from publicsuffix import get_public_suffix
            >>> from publicsuffix import fetch
            >>> psl_file = fetch()
            >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.com', psl_file)
            'example.com'
        
        Note that the once loaded, the data file is cached and therefore fetched only
        once.

        The API is essentially the same as publicsuffix including using the same package
        name to allow a straight forward replacement.
