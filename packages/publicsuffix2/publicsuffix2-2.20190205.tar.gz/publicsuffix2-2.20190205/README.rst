Public Suffix List module for Python
====================================

This module allows you to get the public suffix of a domain name using the
Public Suffix List from http://publicsuffix.org

A public suffix is a domain suffix under which you can register domain
names. Some examples of public suffixes are ".com", ".co.uk" and "pvt.k12.wy.us".
Accurately knowing the public suffix of a domain is useful when handling
web browser cookies, highlighting the most important part of a domain name
in a user interface or sorting URLs by web site.

This Python module includes with a copy of the Public Suffix List so that it is
usable out of the box. Newer versions try to provide reasonably fresh copies of
this list. It also includes a convenience method to fetch the latest list.

The code is a fork of the publicsuffix package and uses the same base API.
You just need to import publicsuffix2 instead

The code is MIT-licensed and the publicsuffix data list is MPL-2.0-licensed.

Usage
-----

Install with::

    pip install publicsuffix2

The module provides a function to query a domain name::

    >>> from publicsuffix2 import get_public_suffix
    >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.com')
    'example.com'
    >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.co.uk')
    'example.co.uk'
    >>> get_public_suffix('www.super.example.co.uk')
    'example.co.uk'

This function loads and caches the public suffix list.

For more control, there is also a class that parses a Public
Suffix List and allows the same queries on individual domain names::

    >>> from publicsuffix2 import PublicSuffixList
    >>> psl = PublicSuffixList()
    >>> psl.get_public_suffix('www.example.com')
    'example.com'
    >>> psl.get_public_suffix('www.example.co.uk')
    'example.co.uk'
    >>> psl.get_public_suffix('www.super.example.co.uk')
    'example.co.uk'

Note that the ``host`` part of an URL can contain strings that are
not plain DNS domain names (IP addresses, Punycode-encoded names, name in
combination with a port number or a username, etc.). It is up to the
caller to ensure only domain names are passed to the get_public_suffix()
method.


The get_public_suffix() function and the PublicSuffixList class initializer accept
an optional argument pointing to a public suffix file. This can either be a file
path, an iterable of public suffix lines, or a file-like object pointing to an
opened list::

    >>> from publicsuffix import get_public_suffix
    >>> psl_file = 'path to some psl data file'
    >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.com', psl_file)
    'example.com'

Note that when using get_public_suffix() a global cache keeps the latest provided
suffix list data.  This will use the cached latest loaded above::

    >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.co.uk')
    'example.co.uk'


To update the bundled suffix list use the provided setup.py command::

    python setup.py update_psl
    
The update list will be saved in `src/publicsuffix2/public_suffix_list.dat`
and you can build a new wheel with this bundled data.

Alternatively, there is a fetch() function that will fetch the latest version
of a Public Suffix data file from https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat
You can use it this way::

    >>> from publicsuffix import get_public_suffix
    >>> from publicsuffix import fetch
    >>> psl_file = fetch()
    >>> get_public_suffix('www.example.com', psl_file)
    'example.com'

Note that the once loaded, the data file is cached and therefore fetched only
once.
