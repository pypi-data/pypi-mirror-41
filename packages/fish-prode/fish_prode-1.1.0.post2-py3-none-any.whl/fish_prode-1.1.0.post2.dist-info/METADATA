# FISH-ProDe v1.1.0.post2

**FISH Pro**be **De**sign (**FISH-ProDe**, pronounced "proâ€§de", "brave" or "valiant" in *italian*) is a Python3 package suite of tools for selection of complementary oligonucleotides to build FISH probes. It also includes a web interface to simplify the selection and remove any need for programming skills.

Read the [documentation](https://ggirelli.github.io/fish-prode/) for more details.
