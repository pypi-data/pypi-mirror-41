# TensorFlow Extra Operations

> pip install tfops

This repository contains various helpful, high-level operations implemented in Tensorflow. Mostly comprises of operations from the newest research papers in the deep learning field that are not yet available in Tensorflow. However, included are some standard, well-established operations that are simply missing from TF, like image preprocessing techniques and other helpful methods for reference.

Some operations here might already be implemented in other libraries, such as Keras. The point is not to reinvent the wheel as this repository also serves as a reference for understanding how those methods work and how they could be implemented in raw Tensorflow.

## Test

TODO: Will add unit tests soon.
