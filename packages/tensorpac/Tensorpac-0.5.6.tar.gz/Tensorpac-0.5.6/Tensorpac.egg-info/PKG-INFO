        Description
        ===========
        
        Tensorpac is an Python open-source toolbox for computing Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) using tensors and parallel computing for an efficient, and highly flexible modular implementation of PAC metrics both known and novel. Check out our `documentation <http://etiennecmb.github.io/tensorpac/>`_  for details.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Tensorpac uses NumPy, SciPy and joblib for parallel computing. To get started, just open your terminal and run :
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            pip install tensorpac
        
        Code snippet & illustration
        ===========================
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          from tensorpac.utils import pac_signals_tort
          from tensorpac import Pac
        
          # Dataset of signals artificially coupled between 10hz and 100hz :
          n = 20     # number of datasets
          sf = 512.  # sampling frequency
        
          # Create artificially coupled signals using Tort method :
          data, time = pac_signals_tort(fpha=10, famp=100, noise=2, ntrials=n,
                                        dpha=10, damp=10, sf=sf)
        
          # Define a PAC object :
          p = Pac(idpac=(4, 0, 0), fpha=(2, 20, 1, 1), famp=(60, 150, 5, 5),
                  dcomplex='wavelet', width=12)
          # Filter the data and extract PAC :
          xpac = p.filterfit(sf, data, axis=1)
        
          # Plot your Phase-Amplitude Coupling :
          p.comodulogram(xpac.mean(-1), title='Contour plot with 5 regions',
                         cmap='Spectral_r', plotas='contour', ncontours=5)
        
          p.show()
