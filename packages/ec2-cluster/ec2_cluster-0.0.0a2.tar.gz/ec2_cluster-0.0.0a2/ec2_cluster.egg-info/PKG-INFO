Description: # ec2-cluster
        
        Simple library and CLI to manage and work with clusters of EC2 instances. Multi-purpose, but created to make distributed deep learning infrastructure easier.
        
        
        ### Goals
        
        - Provide the minimal set of features to run distributed deep learning training jobs on EC2 instances.
        - Provide libraries, not a framework or platform.
        - Make cluster environments reproducible to allow for parallelization of experiments
        - Make cluster launches fast 
        - Focus on iterative, not disruptive, improvements on the common methodology of manually launching EC2 instances, ssh-ing to them, configuring environments by hand and running training scripts*
        
        ### Quick Start
        
        ### Libraries
        
        EC2Node and EC2NodeCluster are classes for working with EC2 instances.
