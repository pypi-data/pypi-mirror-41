Description: airport-py
        ==========
        
        Tiny MacOS only python library to integrate/use wi-fi scan results in your python projects. Wi-Fi scan data gathered by calling & parsing the results of a small MacOS cli utility called "[airport](https://eclecticlight.co/2017/07/08/airport-a-hidden-wi-fi-tool-in-macos-sierra)".
        
        `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport` is the default path to program executable. Exporting environment variable `AIRPORT_PATH` will update the defaults if you have your executable in a different path.
