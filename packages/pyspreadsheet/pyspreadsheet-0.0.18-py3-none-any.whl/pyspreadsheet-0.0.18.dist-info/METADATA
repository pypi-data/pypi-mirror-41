        =====
        
        A python package to easily send data to Google Sheets
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        
        1) Installation
        '''''''''''''''
        
        Open a terminal and install pyspreadsheet package
        
        ::
        
            pip install pyspreadsheet
        
        
        2) Use
        ''''''
        
        1) Find a client_secrets.json file
        
        Log into the Google Developers Console with the Google account whose spreadsheets you want to access. Create (or select) a project and enable the Drive API and Sheets API (under Google Apps APIs).
        Go to the Credentials for your project and create New credentials > OAuth client ID > of type Other. In the list of your OAuth 2.0 client IDs click Download JSON for the Client ID you just created. Save the file as client_secrets.json.
        
        
        2) Be sure that you have set environment variables with path to client_secrets.json file (by default ./)  and a path where pyspreadsheet will store Google Credentials (by default ./)
        
        
        ::
        
            export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_PATH="./"
            export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH="./"
        
        3) Prepare your data like that:
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
            data = {
                    "worksheet_name"    : 'name_of_the_worsheet_you_want_to_send_data'
                    "columns_name"  : [first_column_name,second_column_name,...,last_column_name],
                    "rows"      : [[first_raw_value,second_raw_value,...,last_raw_value],...]
                }
        
        4) Send your data to the right with the sheet_id paramater:
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import pyspreadsheet
            pyspreadsheet.send_to_sheet(sheet_id, data)
        
        - pyspreadsheet will warn you if it has to overwrite some data, except if first row (column_name) are the same than column_name you want to send
        
        2) Import from Redshift to Google Sheets
        ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        pyspreadsheet has a function to export result of a Amazon Redshift query to a Google Sheet. This use `pyred <https://github.com/dacker-team/pyred/>`_.
        Simply write:
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import pyspreadsheet
            pyspreadsheet.redshift.query_to_sheet(sheet_id, worksheet_name, instance, query)
