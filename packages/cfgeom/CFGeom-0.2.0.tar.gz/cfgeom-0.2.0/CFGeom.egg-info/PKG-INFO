        A Python Reference Implementation for Representing Geometries in NetCDF Following the CF Conventions
        
        This project demonstrates how points, lines, polygons, and their multipart equivalents can be represented in NetCDF-CF. The project includes a Python reference implementation for reading and writing geometries in a netCDF file.
        
        For more on this project, see the [documentation](https://twhiteaker.github.io/CFGeom/), or get started with the [tutorial](https://twhiteaker.github.io/CFGeom/tutorial.html).
        
        To view the geometries specification including examples, see [Chapter 7 of the
        CF
        Conventions](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/blob/master/ch07.adoc#geometries).
        
        You may also be interested in the [R reference implementation](https://github.com/dblodgett-usgs/NCDFSG).
        
        
        ## Use Cases
        
        * Encode watershed model time series and polygons in a single file to archive model output and geometry.
        * Encode a streamflow value for each river line in the conterminous U.S. at a given point in time.
