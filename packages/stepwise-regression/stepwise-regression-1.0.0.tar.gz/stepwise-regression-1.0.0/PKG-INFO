Description: # Stepwise Regression
         
        A python package which executes linear regression forward and backward
        
        # Usage
        
        The package can be imported and the functions mentioned below can be used.
        
        forward_regression:
        
        Performs a forward feature selection 
            based on p-value from statsmodels.api.OLS
            Arguments:
                X - pandas.DataFrame with candidate features
                y - list-like with the target
                threshold_in - include a feature if its p-value < threshold_in
                verbose - whether to print the sequence of inclusions and exclusions
            Returns: list of selected features
            
        backward_regression:
        
        Performs a forward feature selection 
            based on p-value from statsmodels.api.OLS
            Arguments:
                X - pandas.DataFrame with candidate features
                y - list-like with the target
                threshold_out - exclude a feature if its p-value > threshold_out
                verbose - whether to print the sequence of inclusions and exclusions
            Returns: list of selected features
