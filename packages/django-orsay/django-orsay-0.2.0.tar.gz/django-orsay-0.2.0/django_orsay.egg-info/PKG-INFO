Description: django-orsay
        ************
        
        A toolkit for doing static site generation for sites that are photo heavy. Was 
        built to create online photo albums for trips. Most static site generators 
        emphasize blogging, this builds on django templating to quickly create a
        one-off site like a travel album.
        
        This isn't really ready to be packaged and put up on pypi yet, not sure if it
        ever will be. In the meantime, if it is helpful to you, feel free to use it.
