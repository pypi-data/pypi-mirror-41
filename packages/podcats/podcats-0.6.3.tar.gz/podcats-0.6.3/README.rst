Podcats generates RSS feeds for podcast episodes from local audio files and,
optionally, exposes both the feed and episodes via a built in web server,
so that they can be conveniently imported into iTunes, Overcast or another
podcast client.


Installation
============
::

    $ pip install podcats


Usage
=====

Generate a podcast RSS from audio files stored in `my/offline/podcasts`::

    $ podcats generate my/offline/podcasts


Generate & serve the feed as well as the files at http://localhost:5000. ::

    $ podcats serve my/offline/podcasts

A web interface is available at http://localhost:5000/web.

You can also generate the html for the web interface. ::

    $ podcats generate_html my/offline/podcasts

For more options see ``podcats --help``.
