# type-this-game

---

Written in: Python

Simple game, where you win by typing the source code of the game itself.

**META!**

For indentation, use four spaces or <kbd>tab</kbd>.

To play:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Laurentiu-Andronache/type-this-game.git
$ cd type-this-game
$ python type-this-game
```

or:

```bash
$ pip install type-this-game
$ python -m type-this-game
```

On Linux, you can also ```chmod +x``` it, and run with ```./type-this-game.py```

If you want level 2, consider changing the script so that it also reports 
the total number of retries (when you're told _No! Try again!_).

If you want level 3, make it compatible with Python 2.7! If you'll do this one, 
please submit a pull request with the modifications.
