"""`tensorflow_datasets` (`tfds`) defines a collection of datasets ready-to-use with TensorFlow.

Warning: these docs are from branch `master`. `tensorflow-datasets` will
release a stable version shortly. Follow the
[release tracking issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/issues/5)
to be notified of release.

Each dataset is defined as a `tfds.core.DatasetBuilder`, which encapsulates
the logic to download the dataset and construct an input pipeline, as well as
contains the dataset documentation (version, splits, number of examples, etc.).

The main library entrypoints are:

* `tfds.builder`: fetch a `tfds.core.DatasetBuilder` by name
* `tfds.load`: convenience method to construct a builder, download the data, and
  create an input pipeline, returning a `tf.data.Dataset`.

Documentation:

* [Available datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/tree/master/docs/datasets.md)
* [Colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/docs/overview.ipynb)
* These API docs
* [Add a dataset](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/tree/master/docs/add_dataset.md)
