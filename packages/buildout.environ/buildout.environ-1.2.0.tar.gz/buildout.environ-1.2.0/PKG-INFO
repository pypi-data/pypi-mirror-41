        ================
        buildout.environ
        ================
        
        Expose system environment variables into `zc.buildout <https://pypi.org/project/zc.buildout/>`_ section.
        
        It is an extension for buildout.
        All variables seen by Pythons ``os.environ`` are available in buildout.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install ``buildout.environ`` by adding it to your buildout extensions::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.environment
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Use ``${__environ__:VARIABLENAME}`` to address any environment variable.
        
        Example::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.environ
            parts = print
        
            [print]
            recipe = mr.scripty
            install =
                print("Found in environ: PATH=${__environ__:PATH}")
        
        To show some variables while running buildout, add a line like this::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.environ
            environ-output =
                PATH
                HOME
        
        This results into an output like this::
        
            buildout.environ: PATH=/home/fido/bin/:/usr/bin/:....
            buildout.environ: HOME=/home/fido
        
        To ensure that some required variables were set,
        an list of required keys is supported::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.environ
            environ-required =
                PATH
                SOMEOTHER
        
        Without setting `SOMEOTHER` this results into an output like this::
        
            buildout.environ: Missing required environment variables: SOMEOTHER
        
        
        Source Code
        -----------
        
        The sources are in a GIT DVCS with its main branches at `github <http://github.com/collective/buildout.environ>`_.
        There you can report issue too.
        
        We'd be happy to see many forks and pull-requests to make this addon even better.
        
        We use `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ (default settings) and `isort <https://readthedocs.org/projects/isort/>`_ (see `setup.cfg`) for code formatting.
        
        Maintainers are `Jens Klein <mailto:jk@kleinundpartner.at>`_ and the BlueDynamics Alliance developer team.
        We appreciate any contribution and if a release is needed to be done on pypi, please just contact one of us.
        We also offer commercial support, training, coaching, integration or adaptions.
