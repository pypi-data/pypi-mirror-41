A wrapper library for WinIO

Thanks for the great WinIO library which comes from Yariv Kaplan.

The WinIO library binary distribution will be accessed from winiobinary package.

NOTE: This library has been renamed from 'rabird.winio' to 'pywinio' after 0.3.0 .

Usage
-----

* Keyboard Emulation

 NOTICE: You must have a ps/2 keyboard connected to your PC if you test on win10 or later, otherwise this sample won't works!

::

    import pywinio
    import time
    import atexit

    # KeyBoard Commands
    # Command port
    KBC_KEY_CMD	= 0x64
    # Data port
    KBC_KEY_DATA = 0x60

    g_winio = None

    def get_winio():
    	global g_winio

    	if g_winio is None:
    		g_winio = pywinio.WinIO()
    		def __clear_winio():
    			global g_winio
    			g_winio = None
    		atexit.register(__clear_winio)

    	return g_winio

    def wait_for_buffer_empty():
    	'''
    	Wait keyboard buffer empty
    	'''

    	winio = get_winio()

    	dwRegVal = 0x02
    	while (dwRegVal & 0x02):
    		dwRegVal = winio.get_port_byte(KBC_KEY_CMD)

    def key_down(scancode):
    	winio = get_winio()

    	wait_for_buffer_empty();
    	winio.set_port_byte(KBC_KEY_CMD, 0xd2);
    	wait_for_buffer_empty();
    	winio.set_port_byte(KBC_KEY_DATA, scancode)

    def key_up(scancode):
    	winio = get_winio()

    	wait_for_buffer_empty();
    	winio.set_port_byte( KBC_KEY_CMD, 0xd2);
    	wait_for_buffer_empty();
    	winio.set_port_byte( KBC_KEY_DATA, scancode | 0x80);

    def key_press(scancode, press_time = 0.2):
    	key_down( scancode )
    	time.sleep( press_time )
    	key_up( scancode )


    # Press 'A' key
    # Scancodes references : https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-1.html
    key_press(0x1E)


Privilege Requirements
-----------------------

WinIo requires administrative privileges to run properly. This can be achieved by:

* Using WinIo from a service running as LocalSystem (SE_LOAD_DRIVER_NAME privilege must be explicitly enabled).
* Embedding a manifest file in the application that requests privilege elevation.
* Requiring the user to choose the "Run as Administrator" option when launching the application.

The included C# samples demonstrate using an embedded manifest file to request privilege elevation.

Driver Signing Requirements on 64-bit Systems
---------------------------------------------

64-bit versions of Windows only load device drivers that are signed by a code signing certificate issued by a public CA such as Verisign, Thawte, etc. WinIo64.sys must not be deployed on production machines unless a code signing certificate is obtained and used to sign this file. The bundled copy of WinIo64.sys is signed with a self-signed certificate and can only be used on development/test machines with Windows running in a special "test" mode. In order to use the bundled version of WinIo64.sys, you need to take the following steps:

* Open an elevated command window by right-clicking the icon and clicking "Run as Administrator".
* Type the following command to enable test-signing:

 ::

  bcdedit.exe /set TESTSIGNING ON

* Reboot the machine
