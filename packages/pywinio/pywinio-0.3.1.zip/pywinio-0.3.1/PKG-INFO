        A wrapper library for WinIO
        
        Thanks for the great WinIO library which comes from Yariv Kaplan.
        
        The WinIO library binary distribution will be accessed from winiobinary package.
        
        NOTE: This library has been renamed from 'rabird.winio' to 'pywinio' after 0.3.0 .

        Privilege Requirements
        -----------------------
        
        WinIo requires administrative privileges to run properly. This can be achieved by:
        
        * Using WinIo from a service running as LocalSystem (SE_LOAD_DRIVER_NAME privilege must be explicitly enabled).
        * Embedding a manifest file in the application that requests privilege elevation.
        * Requiring the user to choose the "Run as Administrator" option when launching the application.
        
        The included C# samples demonstrate using an embedded manifest file to request privilege elevation.
        
        Driver Signing Requirements on 64-bit Systems
        ---------------------------------------------
        
        64-bit versions of Windows only load device drivers that are signed by a code signing certificate issued by a public CA such as Verisign, Thawte, etc. WinIo64.sys must not be deployed on production machines unless a code signing certificate is obtained and used to sign this file. The bundled copy of WinIo64.sys is signed with a self-signed certificate and can only be used on development/test machines with Windows running in a special "test" mode. In order to use the bundled version of WinIo64.sys, you need to take the following steps:
        
        * Open an elevated command window by right-clicking the icon and clicking "Run as Administrator".
        * Type the following command to enable test-signing:
        
         ::
        
          bcdedit.exe /set TESTSIGNING ON
        
        * Reboot the machine
        
        For more information on Windows driver signing requirements, please refer to http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winlogo/drvsign/kmcs_walkthrough.mspx.
