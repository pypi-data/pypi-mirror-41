No doubt, this will change in the future.
For the moment though, we invoke the licence of honour. 
Ask yourself, what would Thor do?

        A python package which mirrors the functionality of 
        [ESO's ``skycalc_cli`` utility](https://www.eso.org/observing/etc/doc/skycalc/helpskycalccli.html),
        but can be used from within an ipython session or Juypter notebook.
