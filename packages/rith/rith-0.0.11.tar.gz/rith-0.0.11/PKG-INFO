        Best Practices
        --------------
        When working with Python applications, it's always advisable to work within
        the constraints of a Virtual Environment.
        
        Arithemtic and the `rith` tools require Python 3+. To create a virtual environment
        that uses Python 3 execute the following command in your project directory.
        
        .. code:: 
        
          virtualenv -p python3 venv
              
        Start Your Virtual Environment
        
        .. code::
          
          source venv/bin/activate
