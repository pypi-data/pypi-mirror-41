Cory,Booker,democratic-party,1969-04-27,male,Contender,"He kicked off the opposition to Brett Kavanaugh with his ""I am Spartacus"" moment that drew the ire of Republican colleagues."
Sherrod,Brown,democratic-party,1952-11-09,male,Underdog,"He's the Democrat who continues to win in Ohio, a critical swing state that has befuddled other Democratic presidential candidates in the last two decades who are not named Barack Obama."
Kirsten,Gillibrand,democratic-party,1966-12-09,female,Underdog,Her determined approach to sexual assault and misconduct led her to say Bill Clinton should have resigned during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Then she led the call among Senate Democrats for Al Franken to resign. Both stances triggered ire among some party donors and activists.
Tim,Kaine,democratic-party,1958-02-26,male,Longshot,"HeÕs stayed quiet on the presidential race, focusing heavily on his reelection campaign. But his resume is as detailed as anyone on this list, including two thorough vettings as a potential Veep."
Amy,Klobuchar,democratic-party,1960-05-25,female,Contender,"SheÕs the cautious centrist in a caucus full of characters. A Democrat in a state Trump came very close to winning, in recent years she's made many trips to neighboring Iowa."
Jeff,Merkley,democratic-party,1956-10-24,male,Longshot,"The only senator to endorse Sanders in 2016, Merkley went viral early this year with a series of videos on opposing the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families at the border."
Kamala,Harris,democratic-party,1964-10-20,female,Contender,"SheÕs used her perch on top committees to grill Trump administration officials and Kavanaugh. She stumped in all early states but New Hampshire, and cut checks to all of their state parties. Her advisers are plotting out an ""SEC primary meets the West Coast offense"" that will play up California's earlier status and seek to make inroads in states like South Carolina and Nevada."
Bernie,Sanders,democratic-party,1941-09-08,male,Contender,HeÕs defied all predictions by going from an unknown senator to a progressive icon. His signature issues have become the lingua franca of liberals on this list.
Mark,Warner,democratic-party,1954-12-15,male,Longshot,"HeÕs the Democratic face of the Russia probe, built from his role as the Senate Intelligence CommitteeÕs ranking member. Warner has tried testing the waters in previous cycles, but heÕs never before had a platform like the Russia investigation."
Elizabeth,Warren,democratic-party,1949-06-22,female,Contender,"She was an academic who helped write the book on how to rein in Wall Street, only to have her dream job (running the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) blocked by Republicans. As a senator she's animated the Democratic base with a populist economic message."
John,Delaney,democratic-party,1963-04-16,male,Longshot,"While almost everyone was trying to tamp down their public interest in running, Delaney announced his campaign and stumped in every early state along with airing TV ads. But can he survive the crush of news that will come as top-tier candidates announce?"
Tulsi,Gabbard,democratic-party,1981-04-12,female,Longshot,"She flouted the DNC in 2016 and backed up Sanders. Her approach to foreign policy, including a visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad, put her outside many in the Democratic mainstream."
Joe,Kennedy,democratic-party,1980-10-04,male,Longshot,He provided the 2018 Democratic English-language response to the State of the Union. References to his famous family are never far away.
Seth,Moulton,democratic-party,1978-10-24,male,Longshot,"HeÕs been pushing hard for more veterans to run for office. And he's been a thorn in Nancy Pelosi's side, positioning himself as part of the next generation of House Democrats."
Beto,O'Rourke,democratic-party,1972-09-26,male,Contender,"A backbench, moderate congressman who transformed into a liberal hero in his failed quest to unseat Ted Cruz. Large crowds, celebrity endorsers and record fundraising sound like a presidential campaign, even if this was just O'Rourke's first statewide campaign. If he can survive potential second-guessing about how he conducted his campaign, he'll come with more name recognition than many on this list."
Tim,Ryan,democratic-party,1973-07-16,male,Longshot,"HeÕs positioned as a lunch pail avatar of the Rust Belt who has criticized Pelosi for not being in touch with the party. HeÕs visited every early state but Nevada, and has also reportedly lured away a top 2016 Sanders alum to advise him in Iowa."
Eric,Swalwell,democratic-party,1980-11-16,male,Longshot,"HeÕs risen to prominence as a member of the House Intelligence Committee by taking on Trump and defending the Russia investigation. HeÕs visited every early state, including Iowa where he plays up his roots. (He was born in Sac City, a small Western Iowa town.)"
Steve,Bullock,democratic-party,1966-04-11,male,Underdog,"He showed the nation how to run as a red-state Democrat. He visited every early state but Nevada, and used his position atop governor groups to build out his national profile and stump in key races around the country."
Andrew,Cuomo,democratic-party,1957-12-06,male,Longshot,"He's Andrew Cuomo. He doesn't show up to his own victory party, because when you're a three-term governor and son of a political institution you donÕt need to."
John,Hickenlooper,democratic-party,1952-02-07,male,Underdog,"HeÕs a centrist, business-oriented governor who led the way on gun control. He visited Iowa and New Hampshire, where heÔs been surprisingly candid about his intentions. The biggest question is if his friendship with Ohio Gov. John Kasich is just that or a hint at an unprecedented bipartisan unity ticket."
Jay,Inslee,democratic-party,1951-02-09,male,Longshot,"HeÕs the climate guy. He visited every early state but South Carolina, although he cut Democrats in the Palmetto State a sizable check. Like other past chairs, he's used his DGA post to burnish his profile. He's also been very candid about his 2020 intentions."
Terry,McAuliffe,democratic-party,1957-02-09,male,Longshot,HeÕs the ultimate Clinton insider who transitioned to being a job-growth governor. He visited every early state but South Carolina Ñ though he held a fundraiser in Washington for the party's gubernatorial nominee.
Martin,O'Malley,democratic-party,1963-01-18,male,Longshot,"HeÕs seen as an ahead-of-the-curve progressive who was swarmed by the Sanders wave. HeÕs returned to every early state, if you count a 2017 South Carolina swing. His early 2016 efforts endeared him to early nominating state activists, but in the end he was overshadowed by Sanders' unexpected rise. Would he try again?"
Deval,Patrick,democratic-party,1956-07-31,male,Longshot,
Michael,Bloomberg,democratic-party,1942-02-14,male,Underdog,"HeÕs a fiscally conservative, socially liberal mayor who has seesawed between parties. His ability to write large checks is far more consistent."
Pete,Buttigieg,democratic-party,1982-01-19,male,Longshot,"HeÕs been positioned as a leader among the next generation of Democrats Ñ openly gay, millennial and Afghanistan veteran. He stumped in South Carolina and had a 2017 stop in Iowa. He was one of just a handful of people on this list to secretly meet with President Barack Obama and boosted his profile during his run for DNC chair. But unlike other mayors on this list, he doesn't have a long list of other elected experience nor has he led a major city."
Eric,Garcetti,democratic-party,1971-02-04,male,Longshot,"HeÕs focused on liberal priorities in a major city on the left coast. HeÕs visited every early state and acknowledged that he's thinking of a 2020 bid Ñ although he might want to stay away from comparing California to Iowa, again."
Mitch,Landrieu,democratic-party,1960-08-16,male,Longshot,"HeÕs a leading Democrat in the south. Landrieu has used his statements on Confederate monuments to build a national reputation. He skipped the early states, but for a 2017 stop in South Carolina."
Joe,Biden,democratic-party,1942-11-20,male,Contender,"Everyone knows Joe Biden. He visited every early state, amid a bevy of midterm stumping. Extolling his lengthy resume, Biden has said he's Òthe most qualified person in the country to be president.Ò "
Julian,Castro,democratic-party,1974-09-16,male,Longshot,"He rode a wave of liberal excitement into a Cabinet seat and was mentioned as a possible 2016 running mate. HeÕs visited every early state but South Carolina. He has said he'd make a decision by early next year, but is leaning toward running."
Hillary,Clinton,democratic-party,1947-10-26,female,Underdog,"Just about every American around for the past three decades knows her for something, even if they weren't part of the 65.8 million votes she won in the 2016 election. Her longtime aides and allies keep hinting a third run could be in store. And she maintained an active presence during the midterms through her PAC."
Eric,Holder,democratic-party,1951-01-21,male,Underdog,He changed the course of the Justice Department after the Bush years with a focus on civil rights and policing. His policies and his friendship with Obama led him to become a Republican boogeyman.
John,Kerry,democratic-party,1943-12-11,male,Underdog,"He survived the 2004 election and later found a new life as ObamaÕs chief diplomat. After avoiding the campaign trail during the midterms, Kerry publicly said he's ""not taking anything off the table"" and continues to think about a second run."
Michael,Avenatti,democratic-party,1971-02-16,male,Longshot,
Mark,Cuban,democratic-party,1958-07-31,male,Longshot,"He knows how to play Trump Ñ with an NBA team. A top Trump agitator in 2016, Cuban has the business background and potential name recognition to take down the former reality TV star in the White House."
Richard,Ojeda,democratic-party,1970-10-25,male,Longshot,"He's one of the first 2020 hopefuls jumping out of the gates after the midterms. He played a key role in West Virginia's successful teacher strikes. And while he lost his congressional campaign, he finished just under 13 points behind in an open-seat contest in a district Trump carried by 49 points in 2016."
Howard,Schultz,democratic-party,1953-07-19,male,Longshot,"HeÕll talk to the nation over a cup of coffee. The former head of a company he built into an internationally recognized brand, Schultz is often mentioned for business background. But in today's hypercritical world is he willing to risk so directly tying Starbucks to a political campaign?"
Tom,Steyer,democratic-party,1957-06-27,male,Longshot,"HeÕs a leading donor to the left, focused on climate activism. No one quite knows what Steyer is going to do with the massive list of people who have signed a petition to impeach President Donald Trump. But the California investor has passed on statewide runs, and after visiting every early state continues to stoke speculation that his ultimate prize is in Washington. Like others in this section, he could easily run without ever gladhanding a single donor."
Oprah,Winfrey,democratic-party,1954-01-29,female,Longshot,"Of anyone on this list, no one has more consistently and emphatically denied interest in running. But we did get to see what it's like when Oprah knocks on doors. Spoiler alert: There are no free cars."
Dwayne,Johnson,democratic-party,1972-05-02,male,Longshot,"Dwayne Johnson says he doesn't have the experience for the job, but his name keeps reemerging. Who knows what the future holds if the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise ever ends?"
